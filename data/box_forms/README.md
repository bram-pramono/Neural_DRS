# Comparing Boxer with Neural DRS Parsing

In this folder you'll find the data of parsed Clausal Forms into Box Forms. Some of the Clausal Forms are parsed from the text using Boxer, marian-based Neural DRS, and allennlp-based Neural DRS. Every parts are named accordingly.

Using the modified_clf_referee.py we can print the results of the DRS clausal form into ASCII box form. Not all clause forms can be transformed into box forms. In this case, the error message will be printed and marked as 10 times X in the box-result.txt.
