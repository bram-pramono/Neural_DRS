On  that  day,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bell  wire  was  neatly  cut,  and  on  Monday  evening  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  was  spending  the  night  with  friends,  so  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  would  have  been  quite  alone  in  the  right  wing,  completely  shut  off  from  help  of  any  kind,  and  would  have  died,  in  all  probability,  before  medical  aid  could  have  been  summoned.
