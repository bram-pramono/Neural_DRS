It  told  me  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  been  writing  the  word  'possessed'  that  afternoon,  and,  having  the  fragment  of  paper  found  in  the  grate  fresh  in  my  mind,  the  possibility  of  a  will...(a  document  almost  certain  to  contain  that  word)...occurred  to  me  at  once.
