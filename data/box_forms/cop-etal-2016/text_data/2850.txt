I,  Hercule  Poirot,  affirm  that  the  man  who  entered  the  chemist's  shop,  and  purchased  strychnine  at  six  o'clock  on  Monday  last  was  not  Mr.  Inglethorp,  for  at  six  o'clock  on  that  day  Mr.  Inglethorp  was  escorting  Mr.s.  Raikes  back  to  her  home  from  a  neighbouring  farm.
