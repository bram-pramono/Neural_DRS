On  the  previous  day,  the  prisoner  had  purchased  strychnine  at  the  village  chemist's  shop,  wearing  a  disguise  by  means  of  which  he  hoped  to  throw  the  onus  of  the  crime  upon  another  man...to  wit,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  husband,  of  whom  he  had  been  bitterly  jealous.
