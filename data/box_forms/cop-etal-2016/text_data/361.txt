I  received  a  letter  from  Evelyn  Howard  a  couple  of  days  after  her  departure,  telling  me  she  was  working  as  a  nurse  at  the  big  hospital  in  Middlingham,  a  manufacturing  town  some  fifteen  miles  away,  and  begging  me  to  let  her  know  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  should  show  any  wish  to  be  reconciled.
