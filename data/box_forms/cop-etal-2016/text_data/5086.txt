I  have  discovered  that  there  were  only  five  short  minutes  in  which  he  could  have  taken  it...the  five  minutes  immediately  before  our  own  arrival  on  the  scene,  for  before  that  time  Annie  was  brushing  the  stairs,  and  would  have  seen  anyone  who  passed  going  to  the  right  wing.
