Now,  if  it  had  been  lost  and  recovered,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  would  at  once  have  replaced  it  on  her  bunch;  but  on  her  bunch  I  found  what  was  obviously  the  duplicate  key,  very  new  and  bright,  which  led  me  to  the  hypothesis  that  somebody  else  had  inserted  the  original  key  in  the  lock  of  the  despatch-case.
