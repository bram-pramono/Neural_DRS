I  told  him  of  my  awakening,  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  dying  words,  of  her  husband's  absence,  of  the  quarrel  the  day  before,  of  the  scrap  of  conversation  between  Mary  and  her  mother-in-law  that  I  had  overheard,  of  the  former  quarrel  between  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  and  Evelyn  Howard,  and  of  the  latter's  innuendoes.
