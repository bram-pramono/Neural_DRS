Her  tall,  slender  form,  outlined  against  the  bright  light;  the  vivid  sense  of  slumbering  fire  that  seemed  to  find  expression  only  in  those  wonderful  tawny  eyes  of  hers,  remarkable  eyes,  different  from  any  other  woman's  that  I  have  ever  known;  the  intense  power  of  stillness  she  possessed,  which  nevertheless  conveyed  the  impression  of  a  wild  untamed  spirit  in  an  exquisitely  civilised  body...all  these  things  are  burnt  into  my  memory.
