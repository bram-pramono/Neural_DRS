I  was  now  sure  that  one,  or  possibly  both  of  the  gardeners...for  there  were  two  sets  of  footprints  in  the  bed...had  entered  the  boudoir,  for  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  merely  wished  to  speak  to  them  she  would  in  all  probability  have  stood  at  the  window,  and  they  would  not  have  come  into  the  room  at  all.
