The  funeral  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  took  place  the  following  day,  and  on  Monday,  as  I  came  down  to  a  late  breakfast,  John  drew  me  aside,  and  informed  me  that  Mr.  Inglethorp  was  leaving  that  morning,  to  take  up  his  quarters  at  the  Stylites  Arms  until  he  should  have  completed  his  plans.
