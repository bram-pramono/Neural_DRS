the intense interest arouse in the public by what be know at the time as ` the Styles Case ' have now somewhat subside .
nevertheless , in view of the world-wide notoriety which attend it , I have be ask , both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves , to write a account of the whole story .
this , we trust , will effectually silence the sensational rumour which still persist .
I will therefore briefly set down the circumstance which lead to my be connect with the affair .
I have be invalide home from the front ; and , after spend some month in a rather depressing Convalescent Home , be give a month 's sick leave .
have no near relation or friend , I be try to make up my mind what to do , when I run across John Cavendish .
I have see very little of he for some year .
indeed , I have never know he particularly well .
he be a good fifteen year my senior , for one thing , though he hardly look he forty-five year .
as a boy , though , I have often stay at style , he mother 's place in Essex .
we have a good yarn about old time , and it end in he invite I down to style to spend my leave there .
the mater will be delighted to see you again.after all those year , he add .
you mother keep well ? I ask .
oh , yes .
I suppose you know that she have marry again ?
I be afraid I show my surprise rather plainly .
mr.s . Cavendish , who have marry John 's father when he be a widower with two son , have be a handsome woman of middle-age as I remember she .
she certainly could not be a day less than seventy now .
I recall she as a energetic , autocratic personality , somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety , with a fondness for open bazaar and play the Lady Bountiful .
she be a most generous woman , and possess a considerable fortune of she own .
they country-place , Styles Court , have be purchase by mr Cavendish early in they married life .
he have be completely under he wife 's ascendancy , so much so that , on die , he leave the place to she for she lifetime , as well as the larger part of he income ; a arrangement that be distinctly unfair to he two son .
they step-mother , however , have always be most generous to they ; indeed , they be so young at the time of they father 's remarriage that they always think of she as they own mother .
Lawrence , the younger , have be a delicate youth .
he have qualify as a doctor but early relinquish the profession of medicine , and live at home while pursue literary ambition ; though he verse never have any marked success .
John practice for some time as a barrister , but have finally settle down to the more congenial life of a country squire .
he have marry two year ago , and have take he wife to live at style , though I entertain a shrewd suspicion that he would have prefer he mother to increase he allowance , which would have enable he to have a home of he own .
mr.s . Cavendish , however , be a lady who like to make she own plan , and expect other people to fall in with they , and in this case she certainly have the whip hand , namely : the purse string .
John notice my surprise at the news of he mother 's remarriage and smile rather ruefully .
rotten little bounder too ! he say savagely .
I can tell you , Hastings , it be make life jolly difficult for we .
as for evie.you remember Evie ?
no .
oh , I suppose she be after you time .
she be the mater 's factotum , companion , Jack of all trade !
a great sport.old evie !
not precisely young and beautiful , but as game as they make they .
you be go to say . . ?
oh , this fellow !
he turn up from nowhere , on the pretext of be a second cousin or something of Evie 's , though she do not seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship .
the fellow be a absolute outsider , anyone can see that .
he be get a great black beard , and wear patent leather boot in all weather !
but the mater cotton to he at once , take he on as secretary.you know how she be always run a hundred society ?
I nod .
well , of course the war have turn the hundred into thousand .
no doubt the fellow be very useful to she .
but you could have knock we all down with a feather when , three month ago , she suddenly announce that she and Alfred be engage !
the fellow must be at least twenty year younger than she be !
it be simply bare-faced fortune hunting ; but there you are.she be she own mistress , and she be married he .
it must be a difficult situation for you all .
difficult !
it be damnable !
thus it come about that , three day later , I descend from the train at Styles St.
Mary , a absurd little station , with no apparent reason for existence , perch up in the midst of green field and country lane .
John Cavendish be wait on the platform , and pilot I out to the car .
get a drop or two of petrol still , you see , he remark .
mainly owe to the mater 's activity .
the village of Styles St.
Mary be situate about two mile from the little station , and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it .
it be a still , warm day in early July .
as one look out over the flat Essex country , lie so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun , it seem almost impossible to believe that , not so very far away , a great war be run its appoint course .
I feel I have suddenly stray into another world .
as we turn in at the lodge gate , John say : I be afraid you will find it very quiet down here , Hastings .
my dear fellow , that be just what I want .
oh , it be pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life .
I drill with the volunteer twice a week , and lend a hand at the farm .
my wife work regularly ` on the land ' .
she be up at five every morning to milk , and keep at it steadily until lunchtime .
it be a jolly good life take it all round.if it be not for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp !
he check the car suddenly , and glance at he watch .
I wonder if we have time to pick up Cynthia .
no , she will have start from the hospital by now .
Cynthia !
that be not you wife ?
no , Cynthia be a protegee of my mother 's , the daughter of a old schoolfellow of hers , who marry a rascally solicitor .
he come a cropper , and the girl be leave a orphan and penniless .
my mother come to the rescue , and Cynthia have be with we nearly two year now .
she work in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster , seven mile away .
as he speak the last word , we draw up in front of the fine old house .
a lady in a stout tweed skirt , who be bend over a flower bed , straighten herself at we approach .
Hullo , Evie , here be we wounded hero !
Mr Hastings.Miss Howard .
Miss Howard shake hand with a hearty , almost painful , grip .
I have a impression of very blue eye in a sunburnt face .
she be a pleasant-looking woman of about forty , with a deep voice , almost manly in its stentorian tone , and have a large sensible square body , with foot to match.these last encase in good thick boot .
she conversation , I soon find , be couch in the telegraphic style .
weed grow like house afire .
can not keep even with 'em .
shall press you in .
better be careful .
I be sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful , I respond .
do not say it .
never do .
Wish you have not later .
you be a cynic , Evie , say John , laugh .
where 's tea today.inside or out ?
out .
too fine a day to be coop up in the house .
come on then , you have do enough garden for today .
` the labourer be worthy of he hire ' , you know .
come and be refresh .
well , say Miss Howard , draw off she gardening glove , I be inclined to agree with you .
she lead the way round the house to where tea be spread under the shade of a large sycamore .
a figure rise from one of the basket chair , and come a few step to meet we .
my wife , Hastings , say John .
I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish .
she tall , slender form , outline against the bright light ; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seem to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eye of hers , remarkable eye , different from any other woman 's that I have ever know ; the intense power of stillness she possess , which nevertheless convey the impression of a wild untame spirit in a exquisitely civilised body.all these thing be burn into my memory .
I shall never forget they .
she greet I with a few word of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice , and I sink into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I have accept John 's invitation .
mr.s . Cavendish give I some tea , and she few quiet remark heighten my first impression of she as a thoroughly fascinating woman .
a appreciative listener be always stimulate , and I describe , in a humorous manner , certain incident of my Convalescent Home , in a way which , I flatter myself , greatly amuse my hostess .
John , of course , good fellow though he be , could hardly be call a brilliant conversationalist .
at that moment a well remembered voice float through the open french window near at hand : then you will write to the Princess after tea , Alfred ?
I will write to Lady Tadminster for the second day , myself .
or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess ?
in case of a refusal , lady Tadminster might open it the first day , and mr.s . Crosbie the second .
then there be the duchess.about the school fete .
there be the murmur of a man 's voice , and then mr.s . Inglethorp 's rise in reply : yes , certainly .
after tea will do quite well .
you be so thoughtful , Alfred dear .
the french window swing open a little wider , and a handsome white-haired old lady , with a somewhat masterful cast of feature , step out of it on to the lawn .
a man follow she , a suggestion of deference in he manner .
mr.s . inglethorp greet I with effusion .
why , if it be not too delightful to see you again , mr Hastings , after all these year .
Alfred , darling , mr hastings.my husband .
I look with some curiosity at ` Alfred darling ' .
he certainly strike a rather alien note .
I do not wonder at John object to he beard .
it be one of the longest and blackest I have ever see .
he wear gold-rimmed pince-nez , and have a curious impassivity of feature .
it strike I that he might look natural on a stage , but be strangely out of place in real life .
he voice be rather deep and unctuous .
he place a wooden hand in mine and say : this be a pleasure , mr Hastings .
then , turn to he wife : Emily dearest , I think that cushion be a little damp .
she beam fondly on he , as he substitute another with every demonstration of the tenderest care .
strange infatuation of a otherwise sensible woman !
with the presence of mr Inglethorp , a sense of constraint and veil hostility seem to settle down upon the company .
Miss Howard , in particular , take no pain to conceal she feeling .
mr.s . Inglethorp , however , seem to notice nothing unusual .
she volubility , which I remember of old , have lose nothing in the intervene year , and she pour out a steady flood of conversation , mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she be organize and which be to take place shortly .
occasionally she refer to she husband over a question of day or date .
he watchful and attentive manner never vary .
from the very first I take a firm and rooted dislike to he , and I flatter myself that my first judgment be usually fairly shrewd .
presently mr.s . inglethorp turn to give some instruction about letter to Evelyn Howard , and she husband address I in he painstaking voice : be soldier you regular profession , mr Hastings ?
no , before the war I be in Lloyd 's .
and you will return there after it be over ?
perhaps .
either that or a fresh start altogether .
Mary Cavendish lean forward .
what would you really choose as a profession , if you could just consult you inclination ?
well , that depend .
no secret hobby ? she ask .
tell me.you be draw to something ?
every one is.usually something absurd .
you will laugh at I .
she smile .
perhaps .
well , I have always have a secret hankering to be a detective !
the real thing.scotland yard ?
or Sherlock Holmes ?
oh , Sherlock Holmes by all means .
but really , seriously , I be awfully draw to it .
I come across a man in Belgium once , a very famous detective , and he quite inflamed I .
he be a marvellous little fellow .
he use to say that all good detective work be a mere matter of method .
my system be base on his.though of course I have progress rather further .
he be a funny little man , a great dandy , but wonderfully clever .
like a good detective story myself , remark Miss Howard .
lot of nonsense write , though .
Criminal discover in last chapter .
every one dumbfounded .
real crime.you would know at once .
there have be a great number of undiscovered crime , I argue .
do not mean the police , but the people that be right in it .
the family .
you could not really hoodwink they .
they would know .
then , I say , much amuse , you think that if you be mix up in a crime , say a murder , you would be able to spot the murderer right off ?
of course i should .
Might not be able to prove it to a pack of lawyer .
but I be certain I would know .
I would feel it in my fingertip if he come near I .
it might be a ` she , ' I suggest .
Might .
but murder 's a violent crime .
associate it more with a man .
not in a case of poisoning .
mr.s . Cavendish 's clear voice startle I .
Dr Bauerstein be say yesterday that , owe to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poison among the medical profession , there be probably countless case of poisoning quite unsuspected .
why , Mary , what a gruesome conversation ! cry mr.s . inglethorp .
it make I feel as if a goose be walk over my grave .
oh , there be Cynthia !
a young girl in V.
a.
D.
uniform run lightly across the lawn .
why , Cynthia , you be late today .
this be mr Hastings.Miss Murdoch .
Cynthia Murdoch be a fresh-looking young creature , full of life and vigour .
she toss off she little V.
a.
D.
Cap , and I admire the great loose wave of she auburn hair , and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she hold out to claim she tea .
with dark eye and eyelash she would have be a beauty .
she fling herself down on the ground beside John , and as I hand she a plate of sandwich she smile up at I .
sit down here on the grass , do .
it be ever so much nicer .
I drop down obediently .
you work at Tadminster , do not you , Miss Murdoch ?
she nod .
for my sin .
do they bully you , then ? I ask , smile .
I should like to see they ! cry Cynthia with dignity .
I have get a cousin who be nursing , I remark .
and she be terrify of ` sister ' .
I do not wonder .
sister be , you know , mr Hastings .
they simply be !
you have no idea !
but I be not a nurse , thank heaven , I work in the dispensary .
how many people do you poison ? I ask , smile .
Cynthia smile too .
oh , hundred ! she say .
Cynthia , call Mr.s . Inglethorp , do you think you could write a few note for I ?
certainly , Aunt Emily .
she jump up promptly , and something in she manner remind I that she position be a dependent one , and that mr.s . inglethorp , kind as she might be in the main , do not allow she to forget it .
my hostess turn to I .
John will show you you room .
supper be at half-past seven .
we have give up late dinner for some time now .
lady Tadminster , we Member 's wife.she be the late Lord Abbotsbury 's daughter.does the same .
she agree with I that one must set a example of economy .
we be quite a war household ; nothing be waste here.every scrap of waste paper , even , be save and send away in sack .
I express my appreciation , and John take I into the house and up the broad staircase , which fork right and leave half-way to different wing of the building .
my room be in the left wing , and look out over the park .
John leave I , and a few minute later I see he from my window walk slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch .
I hear mr.s . Inglethorp call Cynthia impatiently , and the girl start and run back to the house .
at the same moment , a man step out from the shadow of a tree and walk slowly in the same direction .
he look about forty , very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face .
some violent emotion seem to be master he .
he look up at my window as he pass , and I recognize he , though he have change much in the fifteen year that have elapse since we last meet .
it be John 's younger brother , Lawrence Cavendish .
I wonder what it be that have bring that singular expression to he face .
then I dismiss he from my mind , and return to the contemplation of my own affair .
the evening pass pleasantly enough ; and I dream that night of that enigmatical woman , Mary Cavendish .
the next morning dawn bright and sunny , and I be full of the anticipation of a delightful visit .
I do not see mr.s . cavendish until lunch-time , when she volunteer to take I for a walk , and we spend a charming afternoon roaming in the wood , return to the house about five .
as we enter the large hall , John beckon we both into the smoking-room .
I see at once by he face that something disturbing have occur .
we follow he in , and he shut the door after we .
look here , Mary , there be the deuce of a mess .
Evie 's have a row with Alfred Inglethorp , and she be off .
Evie ?
off ?
John nod gloomily .
yes ; you see she go to the mater , and.oh , here 's Evie herself .
Miss Howard enter .
she lip be set grimly together , and she carry a small suit-case .
she look excited and determine , and slightly on the defensive .
at any rate , she burst out , I have speak my mind !
my dear Evelyn , cry mr.s . Cavendish , this can not be true !
Miss Howard nod grimly .
true enough !
afraid I say some thing to Emily she will not forget or forgive in a hurry .
do not mind if they have only sink in a bit .
probably water off a duck 's back , though .
I say right out : ` you be a old woman , Emily , and there be no fool like a old fool .
the man 's twenty year younger than you , and do not you fool yourself as to what he marry you for .
money !
well , do not let he have too much of it .
Farmer Raikes have get a very pretty young wife .
just ask you Alfred how much time he spend over there . ' .
she be very angry .
natural !
I go on , ` I be go to warn you , whether you like it or not .
that man would as soon murder you in you bed as look at you .
he be a bad lot .
you can say what you like to I , but remember what I have tell you .
he be a bad lot ! ' .
what do she say ?
Miss Howard make a extremely expressive grimace .
darling Alfred ' . ` dearest Alfred ' . ` wicked calumny ' . ` wicked lie ' . ` wicked woman ' . to accuse she ` dear husband ' !
the sooner I leave she house the better .
so I be off .
but not now ?
this minute !
for a moment we sit and stare at she .
finally John Cavendish , find he persuasion of no avail , go off to look up the train .
he wife follow he , murmur something about persuade mr.s . inglethorp to think better of it .
as she leave the room , Miss Howard 's face change .
she lean towards I eagerly .
Mr Hastings , you be honest .
I can trust you ?
I be a little startled .
she lay she hand on my arm , and sink she voice to a whisper .
look after she , mr Hastings .
my poor Emily .
they be a lot of sharks.all of they .
oh , I know what I be talk about .
there be not one of they that be not hard up and try to get money out of she .
I have protect she as much as I could .
now I be out of the way , they will impose upon she .
of course , Miss Howard , I say , I will do everything I can , but I be sure you be excite and overwrought .
she interrupt I by slowly shake she forefinger .
young man , trust I .
I have live in the world rather longer than you have .
all I ask you be to keep you eye open .
you will see what I mean .
the throb of the motor come through the open window , and Miss Howard rise and move to the door .
John 's voice sound outside .
with she hand on the handle , she turn she head over she shoulder , and beckon to I .
above all , mr Hastings , watch that devil.her husband !
there be no time for more .
Miss Howard be swallow up in a eager chorus of protest and good-bye .
the Inglethorps do not appear .
as the motor drive away , mr.s . cavendish suddenly detach herself from the group , and move across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who have be evidently make for the house .
the colour rise in she cheek as she hold out she hand to he .
who be that ? I ask sharply , for instinctively I distrust the man .
that be Dr Bauerstein , say John shortly .
and who be Dr Bauerstein ?
he be stay in the village do a rest cure , after a bad nervous breakdown .
he be a London specialist ; a very clever man.one of the greatest living expert on poison , I believe .
and he be a great friend of Mary 's , put in Cynthia , the irrepressible .
John Cavendish frown and change the subject .
come for a stroll , Hastings .
this have be a most rotten business .
she always have a rough tongue , but there be no stauncher friend in England than Evelyn Howard .
he take the path through the plantation , and we walk down to the village through the wood which border one side of the estate .
as we pass through one of the gate on we way home again , a pretty young woman of gipsy type come in the opposite direction bow and smile .
that be a pretty girl , I remark appreciatively .
John 's face harden .
that be Mr.s . Raikes .
the one that Miss Howard . .
exactly , say John , with rather unnecessary abruptness .
I think of the white-haired old lady in the big house , and that vivid wicked little face that have just smile into ours , and a vague chill of foreboding creep over I .
I brush it aside .
style be really a glorious old place , I say to John .
he nod rather gloomily .
yes , it be a fine property .
it will be mine some day.should be mine now by rights , if my father have only make a decent will .
and then I should not be so damned hard up as I be now .
hard up , be you ?
my dear Hastings , I do not mind tell you that I be at my wit 's end for money .
could not you brother help you ?
Lawrence ?
he be go through every penny he ever have , publish rotten verse in fancy binding .
no , we be a impecunious lot .
my mother 's always be awfully good to we , I must say .
that be , up to now .
since she marriage , of course . . he break off , frown .
for the first time I feel that , with Evelyn Howard , something indefinable have go from the atmosphere .
she presence have spell security .
now that security be removed.and the air seem rife with suspicion .
the sinister face of Dr Bauerstein recur to I unpleasantly .
a vague suspicion of every one and everything fill my mind .
just for a moment I have a premonition of approach evil .
I have arrive at style on the 5th of July .
I come now to the event of the 16th and 17th of that month .
for the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incident of those day in as exact a manner as possible .
they be elicit subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examination .
I receive a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of day after she departure , tell I she be work as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham , a manufacturing town some fifteen mile away , and beg I to let she know if mr.s . inglethorp should show any wish to be reconcile .
the only fly in the ointment of my peaceful day be Mr.s . Cavendish 's extraordinary , and , for my part , unaccountable preference for the society of Dr Bauerstein .
what she see in the man I can not imagine , but she be always ask he up to the house , and often go off for long expedition with he .
I must confess that I be quite unable to see he attraction .
the 16th of July fall on a Monday .
it be a day of turmoil .
the famous bazaar have take place on Saturday , and a entertainment , in connection with the same charity , at which Mr.s . Inglethorp be to recite a War poem , be to be hold that night .
we be all busy during the morning arrange and decorate the hall in the village where it be to take place .
we have a late luncheon and spend the afternoon rest in the garden .
I notice that John 's manner be somewhat unusual .
he seem very excited and restless .
after tea , mr.s . Inglethorp go to lie down to rest before she effort in the evening and I challenge Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis .
about a quarter to seven , mr.s . inglethorp call we that we should be late as supper be early that night .
we have rather a scramble to get ready in time ; and before the meal be over the motor be wait at the door .
the entertainment be a great success , mr.s . Inglethorp 's recitation receive tremendous applause .
there be also some tableaux in which Cynthia take part .
she do not return with we , have be ask to a supper party , and to remain the night with some friend who have be act with she in the tableaux .
the follow morning , mr.s . inglethorp stay in bed to breakfast , as she be rather overtire ; but she appear in she briskest mood about 12.30 , .
and sweep Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party .
such a charming invitation from mr.s . Rolleston .
lady Tadminster 's sister , you know .
the Rollestons come over with the conqueror.one of we oldest family .
Mary have excuse herself on the plea of a engagement with dr bauerstein .
we have a pleasant luncheon , and as we drive away Lawrence suggest that we should return by Tadminster , which be barely a mile out of we way , and pay a visit to Cynthia in she dispensary .
mr.s . inglethorp reply that this be a excellent idea , but as she have several letter to write she would drop we there , and we could come back with Cynthia in the pony-trap .
we be detain under suspicion by the hospital porter , until Cynthia appear to vouch for we , look very cool and sweet in she long white overall .
she take we up to she sanctum , and introduce we to she fellow dispenser , a rather awe-inspiring individual , whom Cynthia cheerily address as ` nib ' .
what a lot of bottle !
I exclaim , as my eye travel round the small room .
do you really know what be in they all ?
say something original , groan Cynthia .
every single person who come up here say that .
we be really think of bestow a prize on the first individual who do not say : ` what a lot of bottle ! ' .
and I know the next thing you be go to say be : ` how many people have you poison ? ' .
I plead guilty with a laugh .
if you people only know how fatally easy it be to poison some one by mistake , you would not joke about it .
come on , let 's have tea .
we have get all sort of secret story in that cupboard .
no , lawrence.that 's the poison cupboard .
the big cupboard.that 's right .
we have a very cheery tea , and assist Cynthia to wash up afterwards .
we have just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock come at the door .
the countenance of Cynthia and Nibs be suddenly petrified into a stern and forbid expression .
come in , say Cynthia , in a sharp professional tone .
a young and rather scared look nurse appear with a bottle which she proffer to nib , who wave she towards Cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark : I be not really here today .
Cynthia take the bottle and examine it with the severity of a judge .
this should have be send up this morning .
sister be very sorry .
she forget .
sister should read the rule outside the door .
I gather from the little nurse 's expression that there be not the least likelihood of she have the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded ` sister ' .
so now it can not be do until tomorrow , finish Cynthia .
do not you think you could possibly let we have it tonight ?
well , say Cynthia graciously , we be very busy , but if we have time it shall be do .
the little nurse withdraw , and Cynthia promptly take a jar from the shelf , refill the bottle , and place it on the table outside the door .
I laugh .
discipline must be maintain ?
exactly .
come out on we little balcony .
you can see all the outside ward there .
I follow Cynthia and she friend and they point out the different ward to I .
Lawrence remain behind , but after a few moment Cynthia call to he over she shoulder to come and join we .
then she look at she watch .
nothing more to do , nib ?
no .
all right .
then we can lock up and go .
I have see Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon .
compare to John , he be a astoundingly difficult person to get to know .
he be the opposite of he brother in almost every respect , be unusually shy and reserved .
yet he have a certain charm of manner , and I fancy that , if one really know he well , one could have a deep affection for he .
I have always fancy that he manner to Cynthia be rather constrain , and that she on she side be incline to be shy of he .
but they be both gay enough this afternoon , and chat together like a couple of child .
as we drive through the village , I remember that I want some stamp , so accordingly we pull up at the post office .
as I come out again , I cannon into a little man who be just enter .
I draw aside and apologise , when suddenly , with a loud exclamation , he clasp I in he arm and kiss I warmly .
Mon ami Hastings ! he cry .
it be indeed mon ami Hastings !
Poirot !
I exclaim .
I turn to the pony-trap .
this be a very pleasant meeting for I , Miss Cynthia .
this be my old friend , Monsieur Poirot , whom I have not see for year .
oh , we know Monsieur Poirot , say Cynthia gaily .
but I have no idea he be a friend of yours .
yes , indeed , say Poirot seriously .
I know Mademoiselle Cynthia .
it be by the charity of that good mr.s . inglethorp that I be here .
then , as I look at he inquiringly : yes , my friend , she have kindly extend hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who , alas , be refugee from they native land .
we Belgians will always remember she with gratitude .
Poirot be a extraordinary look little man .
he be hardly more than five foot , four inch , but carry himself with great dignity .
he head be exactly the shape of a egg , and he always perch it a little on one side .
he moustache be very stiff and military .
the neatness of he attire be almost incredible .
I believe a speck of dust would have cause he more pain than a bullet wound .
yet this quaint dandyfied little man who , I be sorry to see , now limp badly , have be in he time one of the most celebrated member of the belgian police .
as a detective , he flair have be extraordinary , and he have achieve triumph by unravel some of the most baffling case of the day .
he point out to I the little house inhabit by he and he fellow Belgians , and I promise to go and see he at a early date .
then he raise he hat with a flourish to Cynthia , and we drive away .
he be a dear little man , say Cynthia .
I would no idea you know he .
you have be entertain a celebrity unaware , I reply .
and , for the rest of the way home , I recite to they the various exploit and triumph of Hercule Poirot .
we arrive back in a very cheerful mood .
as we enter the hall , mr.s . Inglethorp come out of she boudoir .
she look flush and upset .
oh , it be you , she say .
be there anything the matter , Aunt Emily ? ask Cynthia .
certainly not , say mr.s . inglethorp sharply .
what should there be ?
then catch sight of Dorcas , the parlourmaid , go into the dining-room , she call to she to bring some stamp into the boudoir .
yes , m be .
the old servant hesitate , then add diffidently : do not you think , m be , you would better get to bed ?
you be look very tired .
perhaps you be right , dorcas.yes.no.not now .
I have some letter I must finish by post-time .
have you light the fire in my room as I tell you ?
yes , m be .
then I will go to bed directly after supper .
she go into the boudoir again , and Cynthia stare after she .
goodness gracious !
I wonder what be up ? she say to Lawrence .
he do not seem to have hear she , for without a word he turn on he heel and go out of the house .
I suggest a quick game of tennis before supper and , Cynthia agree , I run upstairs to fetch my racquet .
mr.s . Cavendish be come down the stair .
it may have be my fancy , but she , too , be look odd and disturbed .
have a good walk with dr bauerstein ? I ask , try to appear as indifferent as I could .
I do not go , she reply abruptly .
where be Mr.s . Inglethorp ?
in the boudoir .
she hand clench itself on the banister , then she seem to nerve herself for some encounter , and go rapidly past I down the stair across the hall to the boudoir , the door of which she shut behind she .
as I run out to the tennis court a few moment later , I have to pass the open boudoir window , and be unable to help overhear the follow scrap of dialogue .
Mary Cavendish be say in the voice of a woman desperately control herself : then you will not show it to I ?
to which Mr.s . Inglethorp reply : my dear Mary , it have nothing to do with that matter .
then show it to I .
I tell you it be not what you imagine .
it do not concern you in the least .
to which Mary Cavendish reply , with a rise bitterness : of course , I might have know you would shield he .
Cynthia be wait for I , and greet I eagerly with : I say !
there be be the most awful row !
I have get it all out of Dorcas .
what kind of a row ?
between Aunt Emily and he .
I do hope she be find he out at last !
be Dorcas there , then ?
of course not .
she ` happen to be near the door ' .
it be a real old bust-up .
I do wish I know what it be all about .
I think of mr.s . Raikes 's gipsy face , and Evelyn Howard 's warning , but wisely decide to hold my peace , whilst Cynthia exhaust every possible hypothesis , and cheerfully hope , Aunt Emily will send he away , and will never speak to he again .
I be anxious to get hold of John , but he be nowhere to be see .
evidently something very momentous have occur that afternoon .
I try to forget the few word I have overhear ; but , do what I would , I could not dismiss they altogether from my mind .
what be Mary Cavendish 's concern in the matter ?
Mr Inglethorp be in the drawing-room when I come down to supper .
he face be impassive as ever , and the strange unreality of the man strike I afresh .
mr.s . Inglethorp come down last .
she still look agitate , and during the meal there be a somewhat constrain silence .
Inglethorp be unusually quiet .
as a rule , he surround he wife with little attention , place a cushion at she back , and altogether play the part of the devoted husband .
immediately after supper , mr.s . inglethorp retire to she boudoir again .
send my coffee in here , Mary , she call .
I have just five minute to catch the post .
Cynthia and I go and sit by the open window in the drawing-room .
Mary Cavendish bring we coffee to we .
she seem excite .
do you young people want light , or do you enjoy the twilight ? she ask .
will you take mr.s . Inglethorp she coffee , Cynthia ?
I will pour it out .
do not trouble , Mary , say Inglethorp .
I will take it to Emily .
he pour it out , and go out of the room carry it carefully .
Lawrence follow he , and mr.s . Cavendish sit down by we .
we three sit for some time in silence .
it be a glorious night , hot and still .
mr.s . Cavendish fan herself gently with a palm leaf .
it be almost too hot , she murmur .
we shall have a thunderstorm .
alas , that these harmonious moment can never endure !
my paradise be rudely shatter by the sound of a well know , and heartily dislike , voice in the hall .
Dr Bauerstein !
Exclaimed Cynthia .
what a funny time to come .
I glance jealously at Mary Cavendish , but she seem quite undisturbed , the delicate pallor of she cheek do not vary .
in a few moment , Alfred Inglethorp have usher the doctor in , the latter laughing , and protest that he be in no fit state for a drawing-room .
in truth , he present a sorry spectacle , be literally plaster with mud .
what have you be do , doctor ? cry mr.s . Cavendish .
I must make my apology , say the doctor .
I do not really mean to come in , but mr Inglethorp insist .
well , bauerstein , you be in a plight , say John , stroll in from the hall .
have some coffee , and tell we what you have be up to .
thank you , I will .
he laugh rather ruefully , as he describe how he have discover a very rare species of fern in a inaccessible place , and in he effort to obtain it have lose he footing , and slip ignominiously into a neighbouring pond .
the sun soon dry I off , he add , but I be afraid my appearance be very disreputable .
at this juncture , mr.s . inglethorp call to Cynthia from the hall , and the girl run out .
just carry up my despatch-case , will you , dear ?
I be go to bed .
the door into the hall be a wide one .
I have rise when Cynthia do , John be close by I .
there be therefore three witness who could swear that mr.s . inglethorp be carry she coffee , as yet untasted , in she hand .
my evening be utterly and entirely spoil by the presence of Dr Bauerstein .
it seem to I the man would never go .
he rise at last , however , and I breathe a sigh of relief .
I will walk down to the village with you , say mr Inglethorp .
I must see we agent over those estate account .
he turn to John .
no one need sit up .
I will take the latch-key .
to make this part of my story clear , I append the follow plan of the first floor of style .
the servant ' room be reach through the door b .
they have no communication with the right wing , where the Inglethorps ' room be situate .
it seem to be the middle of the night when I be awaken by Lawrence Cavendish .
he have a candle in he hand , and the agitation of he face tell I at once that something be seriously wrong .
what be the matter ? I ask , sit up in bed , and try to collect my scattered thought .
we be afraid my mother be very ill .
she seem to be have some kind of fit .
unfortunately she have lock herself in .
I will come at once .
I spring out of bed ; and , pull on a dressing-gown , follow Lawrence along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house .
John Cavendish join we , and one or two of the servant be stand round in a state of awe-stricken excitement .
Lawrence turn to he brother .
what do you think we have better do ?
never , I think , have he indecision of character be more apparent .
John rattle the handle of mr.s . Inglethorp 's door violently , but with no effect .
it be obviously lock or bolt on the inside .
the whole household be arouse by now .
the most alarming sound be audible from the interior of the room .
clearly something must be do .
try go through mr Inglethorp 's room , sir , cry Dorcas .
oh , the poor mistress !
suddenly I realize that Alfred Inglethorp be not with us.that he alone have give no sign of he presence .
John open the door of he room .
it be pitch dark , but Lawrence be follow with the candle , and by its feeble light we see that the bed have not be sleep in , and that there be no sign of the room have be occupy .
we go straight to the connect door .
that , too , be lock or bolt on the inside .
what be to be do ?
oh , dear , sir , cry Dorcas , wring she hand , what ever shall we do ?
we must try and break the door in , I suppose .
it will be a tough job , though .
here , let one of the maid go down and wake Baily and tell he to go for Dr Wilkins at once .
now then , we will have a try at the door .
half a moment , though , be not there a door into Miss Cynthia 's room ?
yes , sir , but that be always bolt .
it be never be undo .
well , we might just see .
he run rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia 's room .
Mary Cavendish be there , shake the girl , who must have be a unusually sound sleeper , and try to wake she .
in a moment or two he be back .
no good .
that be bolt too .
we must break in the door .
I think this one be a shade less solid than the one in the passage .
we strain and heave together .
the framework of the door be solid , and for a long time it resist we effort , but at last we feel it give beneath we weight , and finally , with a resounding crash , it be burst open .
we stumble in together , Lawrence still hold he candle .
mr.s . inglethorp be lie on the bed , she whole form agitate by violent convulsion , in one of which she must have overturn the table beside she .
as we enter , however , she limb relax , and she fall back upon the pillow .
John stride across the room , and light the gas .
turn to Annie , one of the housemaid , he send she downstairs to the dining-room for brandy .
then he go across to he mother whilst I unbolt the door that give on the corridor .
I turn to Lawrence , to suggest that I have better leave they now that there be no further need of my service , but the word be freeze on my lip .
never have I see such a ghastly look on any man 's face .
he be white as chalk , the candle he hold in he shake hand be sputter onto the carpet , and he eye , petrified with terror , or some such kindred emotion , stare fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall .
it be as though he have see something that turn he to stone .
I instinctively follow the direction of he eye , but I could see nothing unusual .
the still feebly flicker ash in the grate , and the row of prim ornament on the mantelpiece , be surely harmless enough .
the violence of mr.s . Inglethorp 's attack seem to be pass .
she be able to speak in short gasp .
better now.very sudden.stupid of me.to lock myself in .
a shadow fall on the bed and , look up , I see Mary Cavendish standing near the door with she arm around Cynthia .
she seem to be support the girl , who look utterly dazed and unlike herself .
she face be heavily flush , and she yawn repeatedly .
Poor Cynthia be quite frightened , say mr.s . Cavendish in a low clear voice .
she herself , I notice , be dress in she white land smock .
then it must be later than I think .
I see that a faint streak of daylight be show through the curtain of the window , and that the clock on the mantelpiece point to close upon five o'clock .
a strangle cry from the bed startle I .
a fresh access of pain seize the unfortunate old lady .
the convulsion be of a violence terrible to behold .
everything be confusion .
we throng round she , powerless to help or alleviate .
a final convulsion lift she from the bed , until she appear to rest upon she head and she heel , with she body arch in a extraordinary manner .
in vain Mary and John try to administer more brandy .
the moment fly .
again the body arch itself in that peculiar fashion .
at that moment , Dr Bauerstein push he way authoritatively into the room .
for one instant he stop dead , stare at the figure on the bed , and , at the same instant , mr.s . inglethorp cry out in a strangle voice , she eye fix on the doctor : Alfred.Alfred . . then she fall back motionless on the pillow .
with a stride , the doctor reach the bed , and seize she arm work they energetically , apply what I know to be artificial respiration .
he issue a few short sharp order to the servant .
a imperious wave of he hand drive we all to the door .
we watch he , fascinate , though I think we all know in we heart that it be too late , and that nothing could be do now .
I could see by the expression on he face that he himself have little hope .
finally he abandon he task , shake he head gravely .
at that moment , we hear footstep outside , and Dr Wilkins , Mr.s . Inglethorp 's own doctor , a portly , fussy little man , come bustling in .
in a few word drbauerstein explain how he have happen to be pass the lodge gate as the car come out , and have run up to the house as fast as he could , whilst the car go on to fetch Dr Wilkins .
with a faint gesture of the hand , he indicate the figure on the bed .
very sad .
very sad , murmured Dr Wilkins .
Poor dear lady .
always do far too much.far too much.against my advice .
I warn she .
she heart be far from strong .
take it easy , ' I say to she , Take.it.easy ' .
but no.her zeal for good work be too great .
Nature rebel .
nature.rebelled .
Dr Bauerstein , I notice , be watch the local doctor narrowly .
he still keep he eye fix on he as he speak .
the convulsion be of a peculiar violence , Dr Wilkins .
I be sorry you be not here in time to witness they .
they be quite.tetanic in character .
ah ! say Dr Wilkins wisely .
I should like to speak to you in private , say Dr Bauerstein .
he turn to John .
you do not object ?
certainly not .
we all troop out into the corridor , leave the two doctor alone , and I hear the key turn in the lock behind we .
we go slowly down the stair .
I be violently excite .
I have a certain talent for deduction , and Dr Bauerstein 's manner have start a flock of wild surmise in my mind .
Mary Cavendish lay she hand upon my arm .
what be it ?
why do Dr Bauerstein seem so.peculiar ?
I look at she .
do you know what I think ?
what ?
listen !
I look round , the other be out of earshot .
I lower my voice to a whisper .
I believe she have be poison !
I be certain Dr bauerstein suspect it .
what ?
she shrink against the wall , the pupil of she eye dilate wildly .
then , with a sudden cry that startle I , she cry out : no , no.not that.not that !
and break from I , flee up the stair .
I follow she , afraid that she be go to faint .
I find she lean against the bannister , deadly pale .
she wave I away impatiently .
no , no.leave I .
I would rather be alone .
let I just be quiet for a minute or two .
go down to the other .
I obey she reluctantly .
John and Lawrence be in the dining-room .
I join they .
we be all silent , but I suppose I voice the thought of we all when I at last break it by say : where be mr Inglethorp ?
John shake he head .
he be not in the house .
we eye meet .
where be Alfred Inglethorp ?
he absence be strange and inexplicable .
I remember mr.s . Inglethorp 's die word .
what lay beneath they ?
what more could she have tell we , if she have have time ?
at last we hear the doctor descend the stair .
Dr Wilkins be look important and excited , and try to conceal a inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm .
Dr Bauerstein remain in the background , he grave bearded face unchanged .
Dr Wilkins be the spokesman for the two .
he address himself to John : mr Cavendish , I should like you consent to a postmortem .
be that necessary ? ask John gravely .
a spasm of pain cross he face .
absolutely , say Dr Bauerstein .
you mean by that . . ?
that neither Dr Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstance .
John bent he head .
in that case , I have no alternative but to agree .
thank you , say Dr Wilkins briskly .
we propose that it should take place tomorrow night.or rather tonight .
and he glance at the daylight .
under the circumstance , I be afraid a inquest can hardly be avoided.these formality be necessary , but I beg that you will not distress yourselve .
there be a pause , and then Dr Bauerstein draw two key from he pocket , and hand they to John .
these be the key of the two room .
I have lock they and , in my opinion , they would be better keep lock for the present .
the doctor then depart .
I have be turn over a idea in my head , and I feel that the moment have now come to broach it .
yet I be a little chary of do so .
John , I know , have a horror of any kind of publicity , and be a easygoing optimist , who prefer never to meet trouble half-way .
it might be difficult to convince he of the soundness of my plan .
Lawrence , on the other hand , be less conventional , and have more imagination , I feel I might count upon as a ally .
there be no doubt that the moment have come for I to take the lead .
John , I say , I be go to ask you something .
well ?
you remember my speaking of my friend Poirot ?
the belgian who be here ?
he have be a most famous detective .
yes .
I want you to let I call he in.to investigate this matter .
What.now ?
before the post-mortem ?
yes , time be a advantage if.if.there have be foul play .
rubbish ! cry Lawrence angrily .
in my opinion the whole thing be a mare 's nest of Bauerstein 's !
wilkin have not a idea of such a thing , until Bauerstein put it into he head .
but , like all specialist , bauerstein 's get a bee in he bonnet .
poison be he hobby , so of course he see they everywhere .
I confess that I be surprise by Lawrence 's attitude .
he be so seldom vehement about anything .
John hesitate .
I can not feel as you do , Lawrence , he say at last .
I be inclined to give Hastings a free hand , though I should prefer to wait a bit .
we do not want any unnecessary scandal .
no , no , I cry eagerly , you need have no fear of that .
Poirot be discretion itself .
very well , then , have it you own way .
I leave it in you hand .
Though , if it be as we suspect , it seem a clear enough case .
God forgive I if I be wrong he !
I look at my watch .
it be six o'clock .
I determine to lose no time .
five minute ' delay , however , I allow myself .
I spend it in ransack the library until I discover a medical book which give a description of strychnine poisoning .
the house which the Belgians occupy in the village be quite close to the park gate .
one could save time by take a narrow path through the long grass , which cut off the detour of the wind drive .
so I , accordingly , go that way .
I have nearly reach the lodge , when my attention be arrest by the run figure of a man approach I .
it be mr Inglethorp .
where have he be ?
how do he intend to explain he absence ?
he accost I eagerly .
my God !
this be terrible !
my poor wife !
I have only just hear .
where have you be ? I ask .
Denby keep I late last night .
it be one o'clock before we would finish .
then I find that I would forget the latch-key after all .
I do not want to arouse the household , so denby give I a bed .
how do you hear the news ? I ask .
wilkin knock Denby up to tell he .
my poor Emily !
she be so self-sacrificing . such a noble character .
she over-tax she strength .
a wave of revulsion sweep over I .
what a consummate hypocrite the man be !
I must hurry on , I say , thankful that he do not ask I whither I be bind .
in a few minute I be knock at the door of Leastways Cottage .
get no answer , I repeat my summons impatiently .
a window above I be cautiously open , and Poirot himself look out .
he give a exclamation of surprise at see I .
in a few brief word , I explain the tragedy that have occur , and that I want he help .
wait , my friend , I will let you in , and you shall recount to I the affair whilst I dress .
in a few moment he have unbar the door , and I follow he up to he room .
there he install I in a chair , and I relate the whole story , keep back nothing , and omit no circumstance , however insignificant , whilst he himself make a careful and deliberate toilet .
I tell he of my awakening , of mr.s . Inglethorp 's die word , of she husband 's absence , of the quarrel the day before , of the scrap of conversation between Mary and she mother-in-law that I have overhear , of the former quarrel between mr.s . inglethorp and Evelyn Howard , and of the latter 's innuendo .
I be hardly as clear as I could wish .
I repeat myself several time , and occasionally have to go back to some detail that I have forget .
Poirot smile kindly on I .
the mind be confuse ?
be it not so ?
take time , mon ami .
you be agitate ; you be excited.it be but natural .
presently , when we be calmer , we will arrange the fact , neatly , each in he proper place .
we will examine.and reject .
those of importance we will put on one side ; those of no importance , pouf ! . he screw up he cherub-like face , and puff comically enough . blow they away !
that be all very well , I object , but how be you go to decide what be important , and what be not ?
that always seem the difficulty to I .
Poirot shake he head energetically .
he be now arrange he moustache with exquisite care .
not so .
Voyons !
one fact lead to another.so we continue .
do the next fit in with that ?
a merveille !
good !
we can proceed .
this next little fact.no !
ah , that be curious !
there be something missing.a link in the chain that be not there .
we examine .
we search .
and that little curious fact , that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally , we put it here !
he make a extravagant gesture with he hand .
it be significant !
it be tremendous !
y.es . ah !
Poirot shake he forefinger so fiercely at I that I quail before it .
beware !
peril to the detective who say : ` it be so small.it do not matter .
it will not agree .
I will forget it . ' .
that way lie confusion !
everything matter .
I know .
you always tell I that .
that be why I have go into all the detail of this thing whether they seem to I relevant or not .
and I be please with you .
you have a good memory , and you have give I the fact faithfully .
of the order in which you present they , I say nothing.truly , it be deplorable !
but I make allowances.you be upset .
to that I attribute the circumstance that you have omit one fact of paramount importance .
what be that ? I ask .
you have not tell I if mr.s . Inglethorp eat well last night .
I stare at he .
surely the war have affect the little man 's brain .
he be carefully engage in brushing he coat before put it on , and seem wholly engross in the task .
I do not remember , I say .
and , anyway , I do not see . .
you do not see ?
but it be of the first importance .
I can not see why , I say , rather nettle .
as far as I can remember , she do not eat much .
she be obviously upset , and it have take she appetite away .
that be only natural .
yes , say Poirot thoughtfully , it be only natural .
he open a drawer , and take out a small despatch-case , then turn to I .
now I be ready .
we will proceed to the chateau , and study matter on the spot .
excuse I , mon ami , you dress in haste , and you tie be on one side .
permit I .
with a deft gesture , he rearrange it .
ca-y-est !
now , shall we start ?
we hurry up the village , and turn in at the lodge gate .
Poirot stop for a moment , and gaze sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park , still glitter with morning dew .
so beautiful , so beautiful , and yet , the poor family , plunge in sorrow , prostrate with grief .
he look at I keenly as he speak , and I be aware that I redden under he prolonged gaze .
be the family prostrate by grief ?
be the sorrow at mr.s . Inglethorp 's death so great ?
I realize that there be a emotional lack in the atmosphere .
the dead woman have not the gift of command love .
she death be a shock and a distress , but she would not be passionately regret .
Poirot seem to follow my thought .
he nod he head gravely .
no , you be right , he say , it be not as though there be a blood tie .
she have be kind and generous to these Cavendishes , but she be not they own mother .
blood tells.always remember that.blood tell .
Poirot , I say , I wish you would tell I why you want to know if mr.s . Inglethorp eat well last night ?
I have be turn it over in my mind , but I can not see how it have anything to do with the matter ?
he be silent for a minute or two as we walk along , but finally he say : I do not mind tell you.though , as you know , it be not my habit to explain until the end be reach .
the present contention be that mr.s . Inglethorp die of strychnine poisoning , presumably administer in she coffee .
yes ?
well , what time be the coffee serve ?
about eight o'clock .
therefore she drink it between then and half-past eight.certainly not much later .
well , strychnine be a fairly rapid poison .
its effect would be feel very soon , probably in about a hour .
yet , in mr.s . Inglethorp 's case , the symptom do not manifest themselves until five o'clock the next morning : nine hour !
but a heavy meal , take at about the same time as the poison , might retard its effect , though hardly to that extent .
still , it be a possibility to be take into account .
but , accord to you , she eat very little for supper , and yet the symptom do not develop until early the next morning !
now that be a curious circumstance , my friend .
something may arise at the autopsy to explain it .
in the meantime , remember it .
as we near the house , John come out and meet we .
he face look weary and haggard .
this be a very dreadful business , Monsieur Poirot , he say .
Hastings have explain to you that we be anxious for no publicity ?
I comprehend perfectly .
you see , it be only suspicion so far .
we have nothing to go upon .
precisely .
it be a matter of precaution only .
John turn to I , take out he cigarette-case , and light a cigarette as he do so .
you know that fellow Inglethorp be back ?
yes .
I meet he .
John fling the match into a adjacent flower bed , a proceeding which be too much for Poirot 's feeling .
he retrieve it , and bury it neatly .
it be jolly difficult to know how to treat he .
that difficulty will not exist long , pronounce Poirot quietly .
John look puzzle , not quite understand the portent of this cryptic say .
he hand the two key which Dr Bauerstein have give he to I .
show Monsieur Poirot everything he want to see .
the room be lock ? ask Poirot .
Dr Bauerstein consider it advisable .
Poirot nod thoughtfully .
then he be very sure .
well , that simplify matter for we .
we go up together to the room of the tragedy .
for convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal article of furniture in it .
Poirot lock the door on the inside , and proceed to a minute inspection of the room .
he dart from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper .
I remain by the door , fear to obliterate any clue .
Poirot , however , do not seem grateful to I for my forbearance .
what have you , my friend , he cry , that you remain there like.how do you say it ? . ah , .
yes , the stuck pig ?
I explain that I be afraid of obliterate any foot-mark .
foot-mark ?
but what a idea !
there have already be practically a army in the room !
what foot-mark be we likely to find ?
no , come here and aid I in my search .
I will put down my little case until I need it .
he do so , on the round table by the window , but it be a ill-advised proceeding ; for , the top of it be loose , it tilted up , and precipitate the despatch-case on the floor .
eh voila une table ! cry Poirot .
ah , my friend , one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort .
after which piece of moralizing , he resume he search .
a small purple despatch-case , with a key in the lock , on the writing-table , engage he attention for some time .
he take out the key from the lock , and pass it to I to inspect .
I see nothing peculiar , however .
it be a ordinary key of the Yale type , with a bit of twisted wire through the handle .
next , he examine the framework of the door we have break in , assure himself that the bolt have really be shoot .
then he go to the door opposite lead into Cynthia 's room .
that door be also bolt , as I have state .
however , he go to the length of unbolt it , and opening and shut it several time ; this he do with the utmost precaution against make any noise .
suddenly something in the bolt itself seem to rivet he attention .
he examine it carefully , and then , nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from he case , he draw out some minute particle which he carefully seal up in a tiny envelope .
on the chest of drawer there be a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it .
a small quantity of a dark fluid remain in the saucepan , and a empty cup and saucer that have be drunk out of stand near it .
I wonder how I could have be so unobservant as to overlook this .
here be a clue worth have .
Poirot delicately dip he finger into liquid , and taste it gingerly .
he make a grimace .
cocoa.with.i think.rum in it .
he pass on to the debris on the floor , where the table by the bed have be overturn .
a reading-lamp , some book , match , a bunch of key , and the crushed fragment of a coffee-cup lay scatter about .
ah , this be curious , say Poirot .
I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it .
you do not ?
observe the lamp.the chimney be break in two place ; they lie there as they fall .
but see , the coffee-cup be absolutely smash to powder .
well , I say wearily , I suppose some one must have step on it .
exactly , say Poirot , in a odd voice .
some one step on it .
he rise from he knee , and walk slowly across to the mantelpiece , where he stand abstractedly finger the ornament , and straighten them.a trick of he when he be agitate .
Mon ami , he say , turn to I , somebody step on that cup , grind it to powder , and the reason they do so be either because it contain strychnine or.which be far more serious.because it do not contain strychnine !
I make no reply .
I be bewilder , but I know that it be no good ask he to explain .
in a moment or two he rouse himself , and go on with he investigation .
he pick up the bunch of key from the floor , and twirl they round in he finger finally select one , very bright and shine , which he try in the lock of the purple despatch-case .
it fit , and he open the box , but after a moment 's hesitation , close and relock it , and slip the bunch of key , as well as the key that have originally stand in the lock , into he own pocket .
I have no authority to go through these papers .
but it should be done.at once !
he then make a very careful examination of the drawer of the wash-stand .
cross the room to the left-hand window , a round stain , hardly visible on the dark brown carpet , seem to interest he particularly .
he go down on he knee , examine it minutely.even go so far as to smell it .
finally , he pour a few drop of the cocoa into a test tube , seal it up carefully .
he next proceeding be to take out a little notebook .
we have find in this room , he say , write busily , six point of interest .
shall I enumerate they , or will you ?
oh , you , I reply hastily .
very well , then .
one , a coffee-cup that have be ground into powder ; two , a despatch-case with a key in the lock ; three , a stain on the floor .
that may have be do some time ago , I interrupt .
no , for it be still perceptibly damp and smell of coffee .
four , a fragment of some dark green fabric.only a thread or two , but recognizable .
ah ! I cry .
that be what you seal up in the envelope .
yes .
it may turn out to be a piece of one of mr.s . Inglethorp 's own dress , and quite unimportant .
we shall see .
five , . this . !
with a dramatic gesture , he point to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table .
it must have be do since yesterday , otherwise a good housemaid would have at once remove it with blotting-paper and a hot iron .
one of my best hat once.but that be not to the point .
it be very likely do last night .
we be very agitate .
or perhaps mr.s . Inglethorp herself drop she candle .
you bring only one candle into the room ?
yes .
Lawrence Cavendish be carry it .
but he be very upset .
he seem to see something over here . I indicate the mantelpiece . that absolutely paralyse he .
that be interesting , say Poirot quickly .
yes , it be suggestive . he eye sweep the whole length of the wall . but it be not he candle that make this great patch , for you perceive that this be white grease ; whereas Monsieur Lawrence 's candle , which be still on the dressing-table , be pink .
on the other hand , mr.s . inglethorp have no candlestick in the room , only a reading-lamp .
then , I say , what do you deduce ?
to which my friend only make a rather irritating reply , urge I to use my own natural faculty .
and the sixth point ? I ask .
I suppose it be the sample of cocoa .
no , say Poirot thoughtfully .
I might have include that in the six , but I do not .
no , the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present .
he look quickly round the room .
there be nothing more to be do here , I think , unless . he stare earnestly and long at the dead ash in the grate .
the fire burns.and it destroy .
but by chance.there might be.let we see !
deftly , on hand and knee , he begin to sort the ash from the grate into the fender , handle they with the greatest caution .
suddenly , he give a faint exclamation .
the forceps , Hastings !
I quickly hand they to he , and with skill he extract a small piece of half char paper .
there , mon ami ! he cry .
what do you think of that ?
I scrutinize the fragment .
this be a exact reproduction of it : . I be puzzle .
it be unusually thick , quite unlike ordinary notepaper .
suddenly a idea strike I .
Poirot ! I cry .
this be a fragment of a will !
exactly .
I look up at he sharply .
you be not surprise ?
no , he say gravely , I expect it .
I relinquish the piece of paper , and watch he put it away in he case , with the same methodical care that he bestow on everything .
my brain be in a whirl .
what be this complication of a will ?
who have destroy it ?
the person who have leave the candle grease on the floor ?
obviously .
but how have anyone gain admission ?
all the door have be bolt on the inside .
now , my friend , say Poirot briskly , we will go .
I should like to ask a few question of the parlourmaid.Dorcas , she name be , be it not ?
we pass through Alfred Inglethorp 's room , and Poirot delay long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it .
we go out through that door , lock both it and that of mr.s . Inglethorp 's room as before .
I take he down to the boudoir which he have express a wish to see , and go myself in search of Dorcas .
when I return with she , however , the boudoir be empty .
Poirot , I cry , where be you ?
I be here , my friend .
he have step outside the french window , and be stand , apparently lose in admiration , before the various shaped flower bed .
admirable !
he murmur .
admirable !
what symmetry !
observe that crescent ; and those diamonds.their neatness rejoice the eye .
the spacing of the plant , also , be perfect .
it have be recently do ; be it not so ?
yes , I believe they be at it yesterday afternoon .
but come in.dorcas be here .
eh bien , eh bien !
do not grudge I a moment 's satisfaction of the eye .
yes , but this affair be more important .
and how do you know that these fine begonia be not of equal importance ?
I shrug my shoulder .
there be really no argue with he if he choose to take that line .
you do not agree ?
but such thing have be .
well , we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas .
Dorcas be stand in the boudoir , she hand fold in front of she , and she grey hair rise in stiff wave under she white cap .
she be the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant .
in she attitude towards Poirot , she be incline to be suspicious , but he soon break down she defence .
he draw forward a chair .
pray be seat , mademoiselle .
thank you , sir .
you have be with you mistress many year , be it not so ?
ten year , sir .
that be a long time , and very faithful service .
you be much attach to she , be you not ?
she be a very good mistress to I , sir .
then you will not object to answer a few question .
I put they to you with mr Cavendish 's full approval .
oh , certainly , sir .
then I will begin by ask you about the event of yesterday afternoon .
you mistress have a quarrel ?
yes , sir .
but I do not know that I ought . . Dorcas hesitate .
Poirot look at she keenly .
my good Dorcas , it be necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible .
do not think that you be betray you mistress 's secret .
you mistress lie dead , and it be necessary that we should know all.if we be to avenge she .
nothing can bring she back to life , but we do hope , if there have be foul play , to bring the murderer to justice .
amen to that , say Dorcas fiercely .
and , name no name , there be one in this house that none of we could ever abide !
and a ill day it be when first ` he ' darken the threshold .
Poirot wait for she indignation to subside , and then , resume he business-like tone , he ask : now , as to this quarrel ?
what be the first you hear of it ?
well , sir , I happen to be go along the hall outside yesterday . .
what time be that ?
I could not say exactly , sir , but it be not tea-time by a long way .
perhaps four o'clock . or it may have be a bit later .
well , sir , as I say , I happen to be pass along , when I hear voice very loud and angry in here .
I do not exactly mean to listen , but.well , there it be .
I stop .
the door be shut , but the mistress be speak very sharp and clear , and I hear what she say quite plainly .
` you have lie to I , and deceive I , ' she say .
I do not hear what mr Inglethorp reply .
he speak a good bit lower than she did.but she answer : ` how dare you ?
I have keep you and clothe you and feed you !
you owe everything to I !
and this be how you repay I !
by bring disgrace upon we name ! ' .
again I do not hear what he say , but she go on : ` nothing that you can say will make any difference .
I see my duty clearly .
my mind be make up .
you need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter I . ' .
then I think I hear they come out , so I go off quickly .
you be sure it be mr Inglethorp 's voice you hear ?
oh , yes , sir , whose else 's could it be ?
well , what happen next ?
later , I come back to the hall ; but it be all quiet .
at five o'clock , mr.s . Inglethorp ring the bell and tell I to bring she a cup of tea.nothing to eat.to the boudoir .
she be look dreadful.so white and upset .
` Dorcas , ' she say , ` I have have a great shock . ' .
` I be sorry for that , m be , ' I say .
` you will feel better after a nice hot cup of tea , m be . ' .
she have something in she hand .
I do not know if it be a letter , or just a piece of paper , but it have write on it , and she keep stare at it , almost as if she could not believe what be write there .
she whisper to herself , as though she have forget I be there : ` these few words.and everything 's change . ' .
and then she say to I : ` never trust a man , Dorcas , they be not worth it ! ' .
I hurry off , and get she a good strong cup of tea , and she thank I , and say she would feel better when she would drunk it .
` I do not know what to do , ' she say .
` scandal between husband and wife be a dreadful thing , Dorcas .
I would rather hush it up if I could . ' .
mr.s . Cavendish come in just then , so she do not say any more .
she still have the letter , or whatever it be , in she hand ?
yes , sir .
what would she be likely to do with it afterwards ?
well , I do not know , sir , I expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers .
be that where she usually keep important papers ?
yes , sir .
she bring it down with she every morning , and take it up every night .
when do she lose the key of it ?
she miss it yesterday at lunch-time , sir , and tell I to look carefully for it .
she be very much put out about it .
but she have a duplicate key ?
oh , yes , sir .
Dorcas be look very curiously at he and , to tell the truth , so be I .
what be all this about a lose key ?
Poirot smile .
never mind , Dorcas , it be my business to know thing .
be this the key that be lose ?
he draw from he pocket the key that he have find in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs .
Dorcas 's eye look as though they would pop out of she head .
that be it , sir , right enough .
but where do you find it ?
I look everywhere for it .
ah , but you see it be not in the same place yesterday as it be today .
now , to pass to another subject , have you mistress a dark green dress in she wardrobe ?
Dorcas be rather startle by the unexpected question .
no , sir .
be you quite sure ?
oh , yes , sir .
have anyone else in the house get a green dress ?
Dorcas reflect .
Miss Cynthia have a green evening dress .
light or dark green ?
a light green , sir ; a sort of chiffon , they call it .
ah , that be not what I want .
and nobody else have anything green ?
no , sir.not that I know of .
Poirot 's face do not betray a trace of whether he be disappointed or otherwise .
he merely remark : good , we will leave that and pass on .
have you any reason to believe that you mistress be likely to take a sleep powder last night ?
not last night , sir , I know she do not .
why do you know so positively ?
because the box be empty .
she take the last one two day ago , and she do not have any more make up .
you be quite sure of that ?
positive , sir .
then that be clear up !
by the way , you mistress do not ask you to sign any paper yesterday ?
to sign a paper ?
no , sir .
when mr Hastings and mr Lawrence come in yesterday evening , they find you mistress busy write letter .
I suppose you can give I no idea to whom these letter be address ?
I be afraid I could not , sir .
I be out in the evening .
perhaps Annie could tell you , though she be a careless girl .
never clear the coffee-cup away last night .
that be what happen when I be not here to look after thing .
poirot lift he hand .
since they have be leave , Dorcas , leave they a little longer , I pray you .
I should like to examine they .
very well , sir .
what time do you go out last evening ?
about six o'clock , sir .
thank you , Dorcas , that be all I have to ask you .
he rise and stroll to the window .
I have be admire these flower bed .
how many gardener be employ here , by the way ?
only three now , sir .
five , we have , before the war , when it be keep as a gentleman 's place should be .
I wish you could have see it then , sir .
a fair sight it be .
but now there be only old Manning , and young William , and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like .
ah , these be dreadful time !
the good time will come again , Dorcas .
at least , we hope so .
now , will you send Annie to I here ?
yes , sir .
thank you , sir .
how do you know that mr.s . Inglethorp take sleep powder ? I ask , in lively curiosity , as Dorcas leave the room .
and about the lose key and the duplicate ?
one thing at a time .
as to the sleep powder , I know by this .
he suddenly produce a small cardboard box , such as chemist use for powder .
where do you find it ?
in the wash-stand drawer in mr.s . Inglethorp 's bedroom .
it be number six of my catalogue .
but I suppose , as the last powder be take two day ago , it be not of much importance ?
probably not , but do you notice anything that strike you as peculiar about this box ?
I examine it closely .
no , I can not say that I do .
look at the label .
I read the label carefully : ` one powder to be take at bedtime , if require .
mr.s . inglethorp . ' .
no , I see nothing unusual .
not the fact that there be no chemist 's name ?
ah !
I exclaim .
to be sure , that be odd !
have you ever know a chemist to send out a box like that , without he print name ?
no , I can not say that I have .
I be become quite excited , but Poirot damp my ardour by remark : yet the explanation be quite simple.so .
do not intrigue yourself , my friend .
a audible creaking proclaim the approach of Annie , so I have no time to reply .
Annie be a fine , strapping girl , and be evidently labour under intense excitement , mingle with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy .
Poirot come to the point at once , with a business-like briskness .
I send for you , Annie , because I think you might be able to tell I something about the letter mr.s . inglethorp write last night .
how many be there ?
and can you tell I any of the name and address ?
Annie consider .
there be four letter , sir .
one be to Miss Howard , and one be to mr Wells , the lawyer , and the other two I do not think I remember , sir.oh , yes , one be to Ross 's , the caterer in Tadminster .
the other one , I do not remember .
think , urge Poirot .
Annie rack she brain in vain .
I be sorry , sir , but it be clean go .
I do not think I can have notice it .
it do not matter , say Poirot , not betray any sign of disappointment .
now I want to ask you about something else .
there be a saucepan in mr.s . Inglethorp 's room with some cocoa in it .
do she have that every night ?
yes , sir , it be put in she room every evening , and she warm it up in the night.whenever she fancy it .
what be it ?
plain cocoa ?
yes , sir , make with milk , with a teaspoonful of sugar , and two teaspoonful of rum in it .
who take it to she room ?
I do , sir .
always ?
yes , sir .
at what time ?
when I go to draw the curtain , as a rule , sir .
do you bring it straight up from the kitchen then ?
no , sir , you see there be not much room on the gas stove , so cook use to make it early , before put the vegetable on for supper .
then I use to bring it up , and put it on the table by the swing door , and take it into she room later .
the swing door be in the left wing , be it not ?
yes , sir .
and the table , be it on this side of the door , or on the farther.servants ' side ?
it be this side , sir .
what time do you bring it up last night ?
about quarter-past seven , I should say , sir .
and when do you take it into mr.s . Inglethorp 's room ?
when I go to shut up , sir .
about eight o'clock .
mr.s . Inglethorp come up to bed before I would finish .
then , between 7.15 .
and 8 o'clock , the cocoa be stand on the table in the left wing ?
yes , sir .
Annie have be grow redder and redder in the face , and now she blurt out unexpectedly : and if there be salt in it , sir , it be not I .
I never take the salt near it .
what make you think there be salt in it ? ask Poirot .
see it on the tray , sir .
you see some salt on the tray ?
yes .
coarse kitchen salt , it look .
I never notice it when I take the tray up , but when I come to take it into the mistress 's room I see it at once , and I suppose I ought to have take it down again , and ask Cook to make some fresh .
but I be in a hurry , because Dorcas be out , and I think maybe the cocoa itself be all right , and the salt have only go on the tray .
so I dust it off with my apron , and take it in .
I have the utmost difficulty in control my excitement .
unknown to herself , Annie have provide we with a important piece of evidence .
how she would have gape if she have realize that she coarse kitchen salt be strychnine , one of the most deadly poison know to mankind .
I marvel at Poirot 's calm .
he self-control be astonishing .
I await he next question with impatience , but it disappoint I .
when you go into mr.s . Inglethorp 's room , be the door lead into Miss Cynthia 's room bolt ?
oh !
yes , sir ; it always be .
it have never be open .
and the door into mr Inglethorp 's room ?
do you notice if that be bolt too ?
Annie hesitate .
I could not rightly say , sir ; it be shut but I could not say whether it be bolt or not .
when you finally leave the room , do Mr.s . Inglethorp bolt the door after you ?
no , sir , not then , but I expect she do later .
she usually do lock it at night .
the door into the passage , that be .
do you notice any candle grease on the floor when you do the room yesterday ?
candle grease ?
oh , no , sir .
mr.s . inglethorp do not have a candle , only a reading-lamp .
then , if there have be a large patch of candle grease on the floor , you think you would have be sure to have see it ?
yes , sir , and I would have take it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron .
then Poirot repeat the question he have put to Dorcas : do you mistress ever have a green dress ?
no , sir .
nor a mantle , nor a cape , nor a.how do you call it ? . a .
Sports coat ?
not green , sir .
nor anyone else in the house ?
Annie reflect .
no , sir .
you be sure of that ?
quite sure .
Bien !
that be all I want to know .
thank you very much .
with a nervous giggle , Annie take herself creakingly out of the room .
my pent-up excitement burst forth .
Poirot , I cry , I congratulate you !
this be a great discovery .
what be a great discovery ?
why , that it be the cocoa and not the coffee that be poison .
that explain everything !
of course it do not take effect until the early morning , since the cocoa be only drunk in the middle of the night .
so you think that the cocoa.mark well what I say , Hastings , the cocoa.contained strychnine ?
of course !
that salt on the tray , what else could it have be ?
it might have be salt , reply Poirot placidly .
I shrug my shoulder .
if he be go to take the matter that way , it be no good argue with he .
the idea cross my mind , not for the first time , that poor old Poirot be grow old .
privately I think it lucky that he have associate with he some one of a more receptive type of mind .
Poirot be survey I with quietly twinkle eye .
you be not please with I , mon amus ?
my dear Poirot , I say coldly , it be not for I to dictate to you .
you have a right to you own opinion , just as I have to mine .
a most admirable sentiment , remark Poirot , rise briskly to he foot .
now I have finish with this room .
by the way , whose be the smaller desk in the corner ?
Mr Inglethorp 's .
ah !
he try the roll top tentatively .
lock .
but perhaps one of mr.s . Inglethorp 's key would open it .
he try several , twist and turn they with a practiced hand , and finally utter a ejaculation of satisfaction .
Voila !
it be not the key , but it will open it at a pinch .
he slide back the roll top , and run a rapid eye over the neatly file papers .
to my surprise , he do not examine they , merely remark approvingly as he relock the desk : decidedly , he be a man of method , this mr Inglethorp !
a ` man of method ' be , in Poirot 's estimation , the highest praise that could be bestow on any individual .
I feel that my friend be not what he have be as he ramble on disconnectedly : there be no stamp in he desk , but there might have be , eh , mon ami ?
yes . he eye wander round the room . this boudoir have nothing more to tell we .
it do not yield much .
only this .
he pull a crumpled envelope out of he pocket , and toss it over to I .
it be rather a curious document .
a plain , dirty look old envelope with a few word scrawl across it , apparently at random .
the following be a facsimile of it .
where do you find this ? I ask Poirot , in lively curiosity .
in the waste-paper waste-paper basket .
you recognise the handwriting ?
yes , it be Mr.s . Inglethorp 's .
but what do it mean ?
Poirot shrug he shoulder .
I can not say.but it be suggestive .
a wild idea flash across I .
be it possible that mr.s . Inglethorp 's mind be derange ?
have she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession ?
and , if that be so , be it not also possible that she might have take she own life ?
I be about to expound these theory to Poirot , when he own word distract I .
come , he say , now to examine the coffee-cup !
my dear Poirot !
what on earth be the good of that , now that we know about the cocoa ?
oh , la la !
that miserable cocoa ! cry Poirot flippantly .
he laugh with apparent enjoyment , raise he arm to heaven in mock despair , in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste .
and , anyway , I say , with increase coldness , as mr.s . Inglethorp take she coffee upstairs with she , I do not see what you expect to find , unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray !
Poirot be sober at once .
come , come , my friend , he say , slip he arm through mine .
ne vous fachez pas !
allow I to interest myself in my coffee-cup , coffee-cup , and I will respect you cocoa .
there !
be it a bargain ?
he be so quaintly humorous that I be force to laugh ; and we go together to the drawing-room , where the coffee-cup and tray remain undisturbed as we have leave they .
Poirot make I recapitulate the scene of the night before , listen very carefully , and verify the position of the various cup .
so mr.s . Cavendish stand by the tray.and pour out .
yes .
then she come across to the window where you sit with Mademoiselle Cynthia .
yes .
here be the three cup .
and the cup on the mantel-piece , half drunk , that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish 's .
and the one on the tray ?
John Cavendish 's .
I see he put it down there .
good .
one , two , three , four , five.but where , then , be the cup of Mr. Inglethorp ?
he do not take coffee .
then all be account for .
one moment , my friend .
with infinite care , he take a drop or two from the grounds in each cup , seal they up in separate test tube , tasting each in turn as he do so .
he physiognomy undergo a curious change .
a expression gather there that I can only describe as half puzzle , and half relieved .
Bien ! he say at last .
it be evident !
I have a idea.but clearly I be mistaken .
yes , altogether I be mistaken .
yet it be strange .
but no matter !
and , with a characteristic shrug , he dismiss whatever it be that be worry he from he mind .
I could have tell he from the beginning that this obsession of he over the coffee be bind to end in a blind alley , but I restrain my tongue .
after all , though he be old , Poirot have be a great man in he day .
breakfast be ready , say John Cavendish , come in from the hall .
you will breakfast with we , Monsieur Poirot ?
Poirot acquiesce .
I observe John .
already he be almost restore to he normal self .
the shock of the event of the last night have upset he temporarily , but he equable poise soon swing back to the normal .
he be a man of very little imagination , in sharp contrast with he brother , who have , perhaps , too much .
ever since the early hour of the morning , John have be hard at work , send telegrams.one of the first have go to Evelyn Howard.writing notice for the papers , and generally occupy himself with the melancholy duty that a death entail .
may I ask how thing be proceed ? he say .
do you investigation point to my mother have die a natural death.or.or must we prepare ourselves for the worst ?
I think , Mr. Cavendish , say Poirot gravely , that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hope .
can you tell I the view of the other member of the family ?
my brother Lawrence be convince that we be make a fuss over nothing .
he say that everything point to its be a simple case of heart failure .
he do , do he ?
that be very interesting.very interesting , murmured Poirot softly .
and mr.s . Cavendish ?
a faint cloud pass over John 's face .
I have not the least idea what my wife 's view on the subject be .
the answer bring a momentary stiffness in its train .
John break the rather awkward silence by say with a slight effort : I tell you , do not I , that Mr. Inglethorp have return ?
Poirot bent he head .
it be a awkward position for all of we .
of course one have to treat he as usual.but , hang it all , one 's gorge do rise at sit down to eat with a possible murderer !
Poirot nod sympathetically .
I quite understand .
it be a very difficult situation for you , Mr. Cavendish .
I would like to ask you one question .
Mr. Inglethorp 's reason for not return last night be , I believe , that he have forget the latch-key .
be not that so ?
yes .
I suppose you be quite sure that the latch-key be forgotten.that he do not take it after all ?
I have no idea .
I never think of look .
we always keep it in the hall drawer .
I will go and see if it be there now .
Poirot hold up he hand with a faint smile .
no , no , Mr. Cavendish , it be too late now .
I be certain that you would find it .
if Mr. Inglethorp do take it , he have have ample time to replace it by now .
but do you think . .
I think nothing .
if anyone have chance to look this morning before he return , and see it there , it would have be a valuable point in he favour .
that be all .
John look perplexed .
do not worry , say Poirot smoothly .
I assure you that you need not let it trouble you .
since you be so kind , let we go and have some breakfast .
every one be assemble in the dining-room .
dining-room .
under the circumstance , we be naturally not a cheerful party .
the reaction after a shock be always try , and I think we be all suffer from it .
decorum and good breeding naturally enjoin that we demeanour should be much as usual , yet I could not help wonder if this self-control be really a matter of great difficulty .
there be no red eye , no sign of secretly indulge grief .
I feel that I be right in my opinion that Dorcas be the person most affect by the personal side of the tragedy .
I pass over Alfred Inglethorp , who act the bereaved widower in a manner that I feel to be disgust in its hypocrisy .
do he know that we suspect he , I wonder .
surely he could not be unaware of the fact , conceal it as we would .
do he feel some secret stir of fear , or be he confident that he crime would go unpunished ?
surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn he that he be already a marked man .
but do every one suspect he ?
what about mr.s . Cavendish ?
I watch she as she sit at the head of the table , graceful , compose , enigmatic .
in she soft grey frock , with white ruffle at the wrist fall over she slender hand , she look very beautiful .
when she choose , however , she face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability .
she be very silent , hardly open she lip , and yet in some queer way I feel that the great strength of she personality be dominate we all .
and little Cynthia ?
do she suspect ?
she look very tired and ill , I think .
the heaviness and languor of she manner be very marked .
I ask she if she be feel ill , and she answer frankly : yes , I have get the most beastly headache .
have another cup of coffee , mademoiselle ? say Poirot solicitously .
it will revive you .
it be unparalleled for the mal de tete .
he jump up and take she cup .
no sugar , say Cynthia , watch he , as he pick up the sugar-tong .
sugar-tong .
no sugar ?
you abandon it in the war-time , eh ?
no , I never take it in coffee .
sacre !
Murmured Poirot to himself , as he bring back the replenish cup .
only I hear he , and glance up curiously at the little man I see that he face be work with suppress excitement , and he eye be as green as a cat 's .
he have hear or see something that have affect he strongly.but what be it ?
I do not usually label myself as dense , but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary have attract my attention .
in another moment , the door open and Dorcas appear .
Mr. Wells to see you , sir , she say to John .
I remember the name as be that of the lawyer to whom Mr.s . inglethorp have write the night before .
John rise immediately .
show he into my study .
then he turn to we .
my mother 's lawyer , he explain .
and in a lower voice : he be also coroner.you coroner.you understand .
perhaps you would like to come with I ?
we acquiesce and follow he out of the room .
John stride on ahead and I take the opportunity of whisper to Poirot : there will be a inquest then ?
Poirot nod absently .
he seem absorb in thought ; so much so that my curiosity be arouse .
what be it ?
you be not attend to what I say .
it be true , my friend .
I be much worry .
why ?
because Mademoiselle Cynthia do not take sugar in she coffee .
what ?
you can not be serious ?
but I be most serious .
ah , there be something there that I do not understand .
my instinct be right .
what instinct ?
the instinct that lead I to insist on examine those coffee-cup .
Chut !
no more now !
we follow John into he study , and he close the door behind we .
Mr. Wells be a pleasant man of middle-age , with keen eye , and the typical lawyer 's mouth .
John introduce we both , and explain the reason of we presence .
you will understand , Wells , he add , that this be all strictly private .
we be still hope that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind .
quite so , quite so , say Mr. Wells soothingly .
I wish we could have spare you the pain and publicity of a inquest , but of course it be quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor 's certificate .
yes , I suppose so .
clever man , bauerstein .
great authority on toxicology , I believe .
indeed , say John with a certain stiffness in he manner .
then he add rather hesitatingly : shall we have to appear as witnesses.all of we , I mean ?
you , of course.and ah.er.mr . . er.inglethorp .
a slight pause ensue before the lawyer go on in he soothing manner : any other evidence will be simply confirmatory , a mere matter of form .
I see .
a faint expression of relief sweep over John 's face .
it puzzle I , for I see no occasion for it .
if you know of nothing to the contrary , pursue Mr. Wells , I have think of Friday .
that will give we plenty of time for the doctor 's report .
the post-mortem be to take place tonight , I believe ?
yes .
then that arrangement will suit you ?
perfectly .
I need not tell you , my dear Cavendish , how distressed I be at this most tragic affair .
can you give we no help in solve it , monsieur ?
interpose Poirot , speak for the first time since we have enter the room .
I ?
yes , we hear that mr.s . inglethorp write to you last night .
you should have receive the letter this morning .
I do , but it contain no information .
it be merely a note ask I to call upon she this morning , as she want my advice on a matter of great importance .
she give you no hint as to what that matter might be ?
unfortunately , no .
that be a pity , say John .
a great pity , agree Poirot gravely .
there be silence .
Poirot remain lose in thought for a few minute .
finally he turn to the lawyer again . Mr.
Wells , there be one thing I should like to ask you.that be , if it be not against professional etiquette .
in the event of mr.s . Inglethorp 's death , who would inherit she money ?
the lawyer hesitate a moment , and then reply : the knowledge will be public property very soon , so if Mr. Cavendish do not object . .
not at all , interpolate John .
I do not see any reason why I should not answer you question .
by she last will , date August of last year , after various unimportant legacy to servant , etc. , .
she give she entire fortune to she stepson , Mr. John Cavendish .
be not that.pardon the question , Mr. Cavendish.rather unfair to she other stepson , Mr. Lawrence Cavendish ?
no , I do not think so .
you see , under the term of they father 's will , while John inherit the property , Lawrence , at he stepmother 's death , would come into a considerable sum of money .
mr.s . Inglethorp leave she money to she elder stepson , know that he would have to keep up style .
it be , to my mind , a very fair and equitable distribution .
Poirot nod thoughtfully .
I see .
but I be right in say , be I not , that by you english law that will be automatically revoke when mr.s . inglethorp remarry ?
Mr. Wells bow he head .
as I be about to proceed , Monsieur Poirot , that document be now null and void .
Hein ! say Poirot .
he reflect for a moment , and then ask : be mr.s . Inglethorp herself aware of that fact ?
I do not know .
she may have be .
she be , say John unexpectedly .
we be discuss the matter of will be revoke by marriage only yesterday .
ah !
one more question , Mr. Wells .
you say ` she last will . ' .
have mr.s . Inglethorp , then , make several former will ?
on a average , she make a new will at least once a year , say Mr. Wells imperturbably .
she be give to change she mind as to she testamentary disposition , now benefit one , now another member of she family .
suppose , suggest Poirot , that , unknown to you , she have make a new will in favour of some one who be not , in any sense of the word , a member of the family.we will say Miss Howard , for instance.would you be surprise ?
not in the least .
ah !
Poirot seem to have exhaust he question .
I draw close to he , while John and the lawyer be debate the question of go through mr.s . Inglethorp 's papers .
do you think mr.s . inglethorp make a will leave all she money to Miss Howard ? I ask in a low voice , with some curiosity .
Poirot smile .
no .
then why do you ask ?
hush !
John Cavendish have turn to Poirot .
will you come with we , Monsieur Poirot ?
we be go through my mother 's papers .
Mr. Inglethorp be quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself .
which simplify matter very much , murmur the lawyer .
as technically , of course , he be entitle . . he do not finish the sentence .
we will look through the desk in the boudoir first , explain John , and go up to she bedroom afterwards .
she keep she most important papers in a purple despatch-case , which we must look through carefully .
yes , say the lawyer , it be quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession .
there be a later will .
it be Poirot who speak .
what ?
John and the lawyer look at he startle .
or , rather , pursue my friend imperturbably , there be one .
what do you mean.there be one ?
where be it now ?
burnt !
Burnt ?
yes .
see here .
he take out the char fragment we have find in the grate in mr.s . Inglethorp 's room , and hand it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he have find it .
but possibly this be a old will ?
I do not think so .
in fact I be almost certain that it be make no earlier than yesterday afternoon .
what ?
impossible !
Broke simultaneously from both man .
Poirot turn to John .
if you will allow I to send for you gardener , I will prove it to you .
oh , of course.but I do not see . .
Poirot raise he hand .
do as I ask you .
afterwards you shall question as much as you please .
very well .
he ring the bell .
Dorcas answer it in due course .
Dorcas , will you tell Manning to come round and speak to I here .
yes , sir .
Dorcas withdraw .
we wait in a tense silence .
Poirot alone seem perfectly at he ease , and dust a forget corner of the bookcase .
the clumping of hobnailed boot on the gravel outside proclaim the approach of Manning .
John look questioningly at Poirot .
the latter nodded .
come inside , Manning , say John , I want to speak to you .
Manning come slowly and hesitatingly through the french window , and stand as near it as he could .
he hold he cap in he hand , twist it very carefully round and round .
he back be much bent , though he be probably not as old as he look , but he eye be sharp and intelligent , and belie he slow and rather cautious speech .
Manning , say John , this gentleman will put some question to you which I want you to answer .
yes sir , mumble Manning .
Poirot step forward briskly .
Manning 's eye sweep over he with a faint contempt .
you be plant a bed of begonia round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon , be you not , Manning ?
yes , sir , I and willum .
and mr.s . Inglethorp come to the window and call you , do she not ?
yes , sir , she do .
tell I in you own word exactly what happen after that .
well , sir , nothing much .
she just tell willum to go on he bicycle down to the village , and bring back a form of will , or such-like . I do not know what exactly.she write it down for he .
well ?
well , he do , sir .
and what happen next ?
we go on with the begonia , sir .
do not mr.s . Inglethorp call you again ?
yes , sir , both I and willum , she call .
and then ?
she make we come right in , and sign we name at the bottom of a long paper.under paper.under where she would sign .
do you see anything of what be write above she signature ? ask Poirot sharply .
no , sir , there be a bit of blot paper over that part .
and you sign where she tell you ?
yes , sir , first I and then willum .
what do she do with it afterwards ?
well , sir , she slip it into a long envelope , and put it inside a sort of purple box that be stand on the desk .
what time be it when she first call you ?
about four , I should say , sir .
not earlier ?
could not it have be about half-past three ?
no , I should not say so , sir .
it would be more likely to be a bit after four.not before it .
thank you , Manning , that will do , say Poirot pleasantly .
the gardener glance at he master , who nod , whereupon Manning lift a finger to he forehead with a low mumble , and back cautiously out of the window .
we all look at each other .
good heaven !
murmur John .
what a extraordinary coincidence .
how.a coincidence ?
that my mother should have make a will on the very day of she death !
Mr. Wells clear he throat and remark drily : be you so sure it be a coincidence , Cavendish ?
what do you mean ?
you mother , you tell I , have a violent quarrel with.some one yesterday afternoon . .
what do you mean ? cry John again .
there be a tremor in he voice , and he have go very pale .
in consequence of that quarrel , you mother very suddenly and hurriedly make a new will .
the contents of that will we shall never know .
she tell no one of its provision .
this morning , no doubt , she would have consult I on the subject.but subject.but she have no chance .
the will disappear , and she take its secret with she to she grave .
Cavendish , I much fear there be no coincidence there .
Monsieur Poirot , I be sure you agree with I that the fact be very suggestive .
suggestive , or not , interrupted John , we be most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidate the matter .
but for he , we should never have know of this will .
I suppose , I may not ask you , monsieur , what first lead you to suspect the fact ?
Poirot smile and answer : a scribble over old envelope , and a freshly plant bed of begonia .
John , I think , would have press he question further , but at that moment the loud purr of a motor be audible , and we all turn to the window as it sweep past .
Evie ! cry John .
excuse I , Wells .
he go hurriedly out into the hall .
Poirot look inquiringly at I .
Miss Howard , I explain .
ah , I be glad she have come .
there be a woman with a head and a heart too , Hastings .
though the good God give she no beauty !
I follow John 's example , and go out into the hall , where Miss Howard be endeavour to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veil that envelop she head .
as she eye fall on I , a sudden pang of guilt shot through I .
this be the woman who have warn I so earnestly , and to whose warning I have , alas , pay no heed !
how soon , and how contemptuously , I have dismiss it from my mind .
now that she have be prove justified in so tragic a manner , I feel ashamed .
she have know Alfred Inglethorp only too well .
I wonder whether , if she have remain at style , the tragedy would have take place , or would the man have fear she watchful eye ?
I be relieve when she shake I by the hand , with she well remember painful grip .
the eye that meet mine be sad , but not reproachful ; that she have be cry bitterly , I could tell by the redness of she eyelid , but she manner be unchanged from its old gruffness .
start the moment I get the wire .
just come off night duty .
hire car .
quickest way to get here .
have you have anything to eat this morning , Evie ? ask John .
no .
I think not .
come along , breakfast 's not clear away yet , and they will make you some fresh tea .
he turn to I .
look after she , Hastings , will you ?
Wells be wait for I .
oh , here 's Monsieur Poirot .
he be help we , you know , Evie .
Miss Howard shake hand with Poirot , but glance suspiciously over she shoulder at John .
what do you mean.helping we ?
help we to investigate .
nothing to investigate .
have they take he to prison yet ?
take who to prison ?
who ?
Alfred Inglethorp , of course !
my dear Evie , do be careful .
Lawrence be of the opinion that my mother die from heart seizure .
more fool , Lawrence !
Retorted Miss Howard .
of course Alfred Inglethorp murder poor emily.as I always tell you he would .
my dear Evie , do not shout so .
whatever we may think or suspect , it be better to say as little as possible for the present .
the inquest be not until Friday .
not until fiddlestick !
the snort Miss Howard give be truly magnificent .
you be all off you head .
the man will be out of the country by then .
if he be any sense , he will not stay here tamely and wait to be hang .
John Cavendish look at she helplessly .
I know what it be , she accuse he , you have be listen to the doctor .
never should .
what do they know ?
nothing at all.or just enough to make they dangerous .
I ought to know.my own father be a doctor .
that little Wilkins be about the greatest fool that even I have ever see .
Heart seizure !
sort of thing he would say .
anyone with any sense could see at once that she husband have poison she .
I always say he would murder she in she bed , poor soul .
now he be do it .
and all you can do be to murmur silly thing about ` heart seizure ' and ` inquest on Friday . ' .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself , John Cavendish .
what do you want I to do ? ask John , unable to help a faint smile .
dash it all , Evie , I can not haul he down to the local police station by the scruff of he neck .
well , you might do something .
find out how he do it .
he be a crafty beggar .
dare say he soak fly papers .
ask Cook if she be miss any .
it occur to I very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof , and keep the peace between they , be likely to prove a herculean task , and I do not envy John .
I could see by the expression of he face that he fully appreciate the difficulty of the position .
for the moment , he seek refuge in retreat , and leave the room precipitately .
Dorcas bring in fresh tea .
as she leave the room , Poirot come over from the window where he have be stand , and sit down face Miss Howard .
Mademoiselle , he say gravely , I want to ask you something .
ask away , say the lady , eye he with some disfavour .
I want to be able to count upon you help .
I will help you to hang Alfred with pleasure , she reply gruffly .
hang 's too good for he .
Ought to be draw and quarter , like in good old time .
we be at one then , say Poirot , for I , too , want to hang the criminal .
Alfred Inglethorp ?
he , or another .
no question of another .
Poor Emily be never murder until he come along .
I do not say she be not surround by sharks.she be .
but it be only she purse they be after .
she life be safe enough .
but along come Mr. Alfred Inglethorp.and within two months.hey presto !
believe I , Miss Howard , say Poirot very earnestly , if Mr. Inglethorp be the man , he shall not escape I .
on my honour , I will hang he as high as Haman !
that be better , say Miss Howard more enthusiastically .
but I must ask you to trust I .
now you help may be very valuable to I .
I will tell you why .
because , in all this house of mourning , yours be the only eye that have weep .
Miss Howard blink , and a new note creep into the gruffness of she voice .
if you mean that I be fond of her.yes , I be .
you know , Emily be a selfish old woman in she way .
she be very generous , but she always want a return .
she never let people forget what she have do for them.and , that way she miss love .
do not think she ever realize it , though , or feel the lack of it .
Hope not , anyway .
I be on a different footing .
I take my stand from the first .
` so many pound a year I be worth to you .
well and good .
but not a penny piece besides.not besides.not a pair of glove , nor a theatre ticket . ' .
she do not understand.was very offended sometimes .
Said I be foolishly proud .
it be not that.but I could not explain .
anyway , I keep my self-respect .
and so , out of the whole bunch , I be the only one who could allow myself to be fond of she .
I watch over she .
I guard she from the lot of they , and then a glib-tongued scoundrel come along , and pooh !
all my year of devotion go for nothing .
Poirot nod sympathetically .
I understand , mademoiselle , I understand all you feel .
it be most natural .
you think that we be lukewarm.that we lack fire and energy.but trust I , it be not so .
John stick he head in at this juncture , and invite we both to come up to mr.s . Inglethorp 's room , as he and Mr. Wells have finish look through the desk in the boudoir .
as we go up the stair , John look back to the dining-room door , and lower he voice confidentially : look here , what be go to happen when these two meet ?
I shake my head helplessly .
I have tell Mary to keep they apart if she can .
will she be able to do so ?
the Lord only know .
there be one thing , Inglethorp himself will not be too keen on meet she .
you have get the key still , have not you , Poirot ? I ask , as we reach the door of the lock room .
take the key from Poirot , John unlock it , and we all pass in .
the lawyer go straight to the desk , and John follow he .
my mother keep most of she important papers in this despatch-case , I believe , he say .
Poirot draw out the small bunch of key .
permit I .
I lock it , out of precaution , this morning .
but it be not lock now .
impossible !
see .
and John lift the lid as he speak .
milles tonnerres ! cry Poirot , dumfounded .
and I.who have both the key in my pocket !
he fling himself upon the case .
suddenly he stiffen .
en voila une affaire !
this lock have be force .
what ?
Poirot lay down the case again .
but who force it ?
why should they ?
when ?
but the door be lock ?
these exclamation burst from we disjointedly .
poirot answer they categorically.almost categorically.almost mechanically .
who ?
that be the question .
why ?
ah , if I only know .
when ?
since I be here a hour ago .
as to the door be lock , it be a very ordinary lock .
probably any other of the doorkey in this passage would fit it .
we stare at one another blankly .
Poirot have walk over to the mantel-piece .
he be outwardly calm , but I notice he hand , which from long force of habit be mechanically straighten the spill vase on the mantel-piece , be shake violently .
see here , it be like this , he say at last .
there be something in that case.some piece of evidence , slight in itself perhaps , but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime .
it be vital to he that it should be destroy before it be discover and its significance appreciate .
therefore , he take the risk , the great risk , of come in here .
find the case lock , he be oblige to force it , thus betray he presence .
for he to take that risk , it must have be something of great importance .
but what be it ?
ah ! cry Poirot , with a gesture of anger .
that , I do not know !
a document of some kind , without doubt , possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas see in she hand yesterday afternoon .
and i. he anger burst forth freely . miserable freely . miserable animal that I be !
I guess nothing !
I have behave like a imbecile !
I should never have leave that case here .
I should have carry it away with I .
ah , triple pig !
and now it be go .
it be destroyed.but be it destroy ?
be there not yet a chance.we must leave no stone unturn .
he rush like a madman from the room , and I follow he as soon as I have sufficiently recover my wit .
but , by the time I have reach the top of the stair , he be out of sight .
Mary Cavendish be stand where the staircase branch , stare down into the hall in the direction in which he have disappear .
what have happen to you extraordinary little friend , Mr. Hastings ?
he have just rush past I like a mad bull .
he be rather upset about something , I remark feebly .
I really do not know how much Poirot would wish I to disclose .
as I see a faint smile gather on mr.s . Cavendish 's expressive mouth , I endeavour to try and turn the conversation by say : they have not meet yet , have they ?
who ?
Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard .
she look at I in rather a disconcerting manner .
do you think it would be such a disaster if they do meet ?
well , do not you ?
I say , rather take aback .
no .
she be smile in she quiet way .
I should like to see a good flare up .
it would clear the air .
at present we be all think so much , and say so little .
John do not think so , I remark .
he be anxious to keep they apart .
oh , John !
something in she tone fire I , and I blurt out : Old John 's a awfully good sort .
she study I curiously for a minute or two , and then say , to my great surprise : you be loyal to you friend .
I like you for that .
be not you my friend too ?
I be a very bad friend .
why do you say that ?
because it be true .
I be charming to my friend one day , and forget all about they the next .
I do not know what impel I , but I be nettle , and I say foolishly and not in the best of taste : yet you seem to be invariably charming to dr bauerstein !
instantly I regret my word .
she face stiffen .
I have the impression of a steel curtain come down and blot out the real woman .
without a word , she turn and go swiftly up the stair , whilst I stand like a idiot gaping after she .
I be recall to other matter by a frightful row go on below .
I could hear Poirot shout and expound .
I be vex to think that my diplomacy have be in vain .
the little man appear to be take the whole house into he confidence , a proceeding of which I , for one , doubt the wisdom .
once again I could not help regret that my friend be so prone to lose he head in moment of excitement .
I step briskly down the stair .
the sight of I calm Poirot almost immediately .
I draw he aside .
my dear fellow , I say , be this wise ?
surely you do not want the whole house to know of this occurrence ?
you be actually play into the criminal 's hand .
you think so , Hastings ?
I be sure of it .
well , well , my friend , I will be guide by you .
good .
although , unfortunately , it be a little too late now .
sure .
he look so crestfallen and abashed that I feel quite sorry , though I still think my rebuke a just and wise one .
well , he say at last , let we go , mon ami .
you have finish here ?
for the moment , yes .
you will walk back with I to the village ?
willingly .
he pick up he little suit-case , and we go out through the open window in the drawing-room .
Cynthia Murdoch be just come in , and Poirot stand aside to let she pass .
excuse I , mademoiselle , one minute .
yes ?
she turn inquiringly .
do you ever make up mr.s . Inglethorp 's medicine ?
a slight flush rise in she face , as she answer rather constrainedly : no .
only she powder ?
the flush deepen as Cynthia reply : oh , yes , I do make up some sleep powder for she once .
these ?
Poirot produce the empty box which have contain powder .
she nod .
can you tell I what they be ?
Sulphonal ?
Veronal ?
no , they be bromide powder .
ah !
thank you , mademoiselle ; good morning .
as we walk briskly away from the house , I glance at he more than once .
I have often before notice that , if anything excited he , he eye turn green like a cat 's .
they be shine like emerald now .
my friend , he break out at last , I have a little idea , a very strange , and probably utterly impossible idea .
and yet.it fit in .
I shrug my shoulder .
I privately think that Poirot be rather too much give to these fantastic idea .
in this case , surely , the truth be only too plain and apparent .
so that be the explanation of the blank label on the box , I remark .
very simple , as you say .
I really wonder that I do not think of it myself .
Poirot do not appear to be listen to I .
they have make one more discovery , la-bas , he observe , jerk he thumb over he shoulder in the direction of style .
Mr. Wells tell I as we be go upstairs .
what be it ?
lock up in the desk in the boudoir , they find a will of mr.s . Inglethorp 's , date before she marriage , leave she fortune to Alfred Inglethorp .
it must have be make just at the time they be engage .
it come quite as a surprise to wells.and to John Cavendish also .
it be write on one of those print will form , and witness by two of the servants.not Dorcas .
do Mr. Inglethorp know of it ?
he say not .
one might take that with a grain of salt , I remark sceptically .
all these will be very confusing .
tell I , how do those scribble word on the envelope help you to discover that a will be make yesterday afternoon ?
Poirot smile .
Mon ami , have you ever , when write a letter , be arrest by the fact that you do not know how to spell a certain word ?
yes , often .
I suppose every one have .
exactly .
and have you not , in such a case , try the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper , or a spare scrap of paper , to see if it look right ?
well , that be what mr.s . inglethorp do .
you will notice that the word ` possess ' be spell first with one 's ' and subsequently with two.correctly .
to make sure , she have further try it in a sentence , thus : ` I be possess . ' .
now , what do that tell I ?
it tell I that mr.s . inglethorp have be write the word ` possess ' that afternoon , and , have the fragment of paper find in the grate fresh in my mind , the possibility of a will . -lrb- a document almost certain to contain that word -rrb- . occur to I at once .
this possibility be confirm by a further circumstance .
in the general confusion , the boudoir have not be sweep that morning , and near the desk be several trace of brown mould and earth .
the weather have be perfectly fine for some day , and no ordinary boot would have leave such a heavy deposit .
I stroll to the window , and see at once that the begonia bed have be newly plant .
the mould in the bed be exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir , and also I learn from you that they have be plant yesterday afternoon .
I be now sure that one , or possibly both of the gardeners.for there be two set of footprint in the bed.had enter the boudoir , for if mr.s . inglethorp have merely wish to speak to they she would in all probability have stand at the window , and they would not have come into the room at all .
I be now quite convinced that she have make a fresh will , and have call the two gardener in to witness she signature .
event prove that I be right in my supposition .
that be very ingenious , I could not help admit .
I must confess that the conclusion I draw from those few scribble word be quite erroneous .
he smile .
you give too much rein to you imagination .
imagination be a good servant , and a bad master .
the simplest explanation be always the most likely .
another point.how do you know that the key of the despatch-case have be lose ?
I do not know it .
it be a guess that turn out to be correct .
you observe that it have a piece of twisted wire through the handle .
that suggest to I at once that it have possibly be wrench off a flimsy key-ring .
now , if it have be lose and recover , mr.s . inglethorp would at once have replace it on she bunch ; but on she bunch I find what be obviously the duplicate key , very new and bright , which lead I to the hypothesis that somebody else have insert the original key in the lock of the despatch-case .
yes , I say , Alfred Inglethorp , without doubt .
Poirot look at I curiously .
you be very sure of he guilt ?
well , naturally .
every fresh circumstance seem to establish it more clearly .
on the contrary , say Poirot quietly , there be several point in he favour .
oh , come now !
yes .
I see only one .
and that ?
that he be not in the house last night .
` bad shot ! ' .
as you english say !
you have choose the one point that to my mind tell against he .
how be that ?
because if Mr. Inglethorp know that he wife would be poison last night , he would certainly have arrange to be away from the house .
he excuse be a obviously trump up one .
that leave we two possibility : either he know what be go to happen or he have a reason of he own for he absence .
and that reason ? I ask sceptically .
Poirot shrug he shoulder .
how should I know ?
discreditable , without doubt .
this Mr. Inglethorp , I should say , be somewhat of a scoundrel.but that do not of necessity make he a murderer .
I shake my head , unconvinced .
we do not agree , eh ? say Poirot .
well , let we leave it .
Time will show which of we be right .
now let we turn to other aspect of the case .
what do you make of the fact that all the door of the bedroom be bolt on the inside ?
well . . I consider .
one must look at it logically .
true .
I should put it this way .
the door be bolted.our own eye have tell we that.yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor , and the destruction of the will , prove that during the night some one enter the room .
you agree so far ?
perfectly .
put with admirable clearness .
proceed .
well , I say , encourage , as the person who enter do not do so by the window , nor by miraculous means , it follow that the door must have be open from inside by mr.s . Inglethorp herself .
that strengthen the conviction that the person in question be she husband .
she would naturally open the door to she own husband .
Poirot shake he head .
why should she ?
she have bolt the door lead into he room.a most unusual proceeding on she part.she have have a most violent quarrel with he that very afternoon .
no , he be the last person she would admit .
but you agree with I that the door must have be open by mr.s . Inglethorp herself ?
there be another possibility .
she may have forget to bolt the door into the passage when she go to bed , and have get up later , towards morning , and bolt it then .
Poirot , be that seriously you opinion ?
no , I do not say it be so , but it might be .
now , to turn to another feature , what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overhear between mr.s . Cavendish and she mother-in-law ?
mother-in-law ?
I have forget that , I say thoughtfully .
that be as enigmatical as ever .
it seem incredible that a woman like mr.s . Cavendish , proud and reticent to the last degree , should interfere so violently in what be certainly not she affair .
precisely .
it be a astonishing thing for a woman of she breeding to do .
it be certainly curious , I agree .
still , it be unimportant , and need not be take into account .
a groan burst from Poirot .
what have I always tell you ?
everything must be take into account .
if the fact will not fit the theory.let the theory go .
well , we shall see , I say , nettle .
yes , we shall see .
we have reach Leastways Cottage , and Poirot usher I upstairs to he own room .
he offer I one of the tiny russian cigarette he himself occasionally smoke .
I be amuse to notice that he stow away the use match most carefully in a little china pot .
my momentary annoyance vanish .
Poirot have place we two chair in front of the open window which command a view of the village street .
the fresh air blow in warm and pleasant .
it be go to be a hot day .
suddenly my attention be arrest by a weedy look young man rush down the street at a great pace .
it be the expression on he face that be extraordinary.a curious mingling of terror and agitation .
look , Poirot ! I say .
he lean forward .
Tiens ! he say .
it be Mr. Mace , from the chemist 's shop .
he be come here .
the young man come to a halt before Leastways Cottage , and , after hesitate a moment , pound vigorously at the door .
a little minute , cry Poirot from the window .
I come .
motion to I to follow he , he run swiftly down the stair and open the door .
Mr. Mace begin at once . oh , .
Mr. Poirot , I be sorry for the inconvenience , but I hear that you would just come back from the hall ?
yes , we have .
the young man moisten he dry lip .
he face be work curiously .
it be all over the village about old mr.s . inglethorp die so suddenly .
they do say . he lower he voice cautiously . that it be poison ?
Poirot 's face remain quite impassive .
only the doctor can tell we that , Mr. Mace .
yes , exactly.of course . .
the young man hesitate , and then he agitation be too much for he .
he clutch Poirot by the arm , and sink he voice to a whisper : just tell I this , Mr. Poirot , it be not . it be not strychnine , be it ?
I hardly hear what Poirot reply .
something evidently of a non-committal nature .
the young man depart , and as he close the door Poirot 's eye meet mine .
yes , he say , nod gravely .
he will have evidence to give at the inquest .
we go slowly upstairs again .
I be open my lip , when Poirot stop I with a gesture of he hand .
not now , not now , mon ami .
I have need of reflection .
my mind be in some disorder.which be not well .
for about ten minute he sit in dead silence , perfectly still , except for several expressive motion of he eyebrow , and all the time he eye grow steadily greener .
at last he heave a deep sigh .
it be well .
the bad moment have pass .
now all be arrange and classify .
one must never permit confusion .
the case be not clear yet.no .
for it be of the most complicated !
it puzzle I .
Me. , Hercule Poirot !
there be two fact of significance .
and what be they ?
the first be the state of the weather yesterday .
that be very important .
but it be a glorious day !
I interrupt .
Poirot , you be pull my leg !
not at all .
the thermometer register 80 degree in the shade .
do not forget that , my friend .
it be the key to the whole riddle !
and the second point ? I ask .
the important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wear very peculiar clothes , have a black beard , and use glass .
Poirot , I can not believe you be serious .
I be absolutely serious , my friend .
but this be childish !
no , it be very momentous .
and suppose the Coroner 's jury return a verdict of wilful murder against Alfred Inglethorp .
what become of you theory , then ?
they would not be shake because twelve stupid man have happen to make a mistake !
but that will not occur .
for one thing , a country jury be not anxious to take responsibility upon itself , and Mr. Inglethorp stand practically in the position of local squire .
also , he add placidly , I should not allow it !
you would not allow it ?
no .
I look at the extraordinary little man , divide between annoyance and amusement .
he be so tremendously sure of himself .
as though he read my thought , he nod gently .
oh , yes , mon ami , I would do what I say .
he get up and lay he hand on my shoulder .
he physiognomy undergo a complete change .
tear come into he eye .
in all this , you see , I think of that poor mr.s . inglethorp who be dead .
she be not extravagantly loved.no .
but she be very good to we Belgians.I owe she a debt .
I endeavour to interrupt , but Poirot sweep on .
let I tell you this , Hastings .
she would never forgive I if I let Alfred Inglethorp , she husband , be arrest now.when a word from I could save he !
in the interval before the inquest , Poirot be unfailing in he activity .
twice he be closet with Mr. Wells .
he also take long walk into the country .
I rather resent he not take I into he confidence , the more so as I could not in the least guess what he be drive at .
it occur to I that he might have be make inquiry at Raikes 's farm ; so , find he out when I call at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening , I walk over there by the field , hope to meet he .
but there be no sign of he , and I hesitate to go right up to the farm itself .
as I walk away , I meet a aged rustic , who leer at I cunningly .
you be from the Hall , bai not you ? he ask .
yes .
I be look for a friend of mine whom I think might have walk this way .
a little chap ?
as wave he hand when he talk ?
one of they Belgies from the village ?
yes , I say eagerly .
he have be here , then ?
oh , ay , he be be here , right enough .
more 'n once too.friend .
of yours , be he ?
ah , you gentleman from the Hall.you 'n a pretty lot !
and he leer more jocosely than ever .
why , do the gentleman from the Hall come here often ? I ask , as carelessly as I could .
he wink at I knowingly .
one do , mister .
name no name , mind .
and a very liberal gentleman too !
oh , thank you , sir , I be sure .
I walk on sharply .
Evelyn Howard have be right then , and I experience a sharp twinge of disgust , as I think of Alfred Inglethorp 's liberality with another woman 's money .
have that piquant gipsy face be at the bottom of the crime , or be it the baser mainspring of money ?
probably a judicious mixture of both .
on one point , Poirot seem to have a curious obsession .
he once or twice observe to I that he think Dorcas must have make a error in fix the time of the quarrel .
he suggest to she repeatedly that it be 4.30 , .
and not 4 o'clock when she have hear the voice .
but Dorcas be unshaken .
quite a hour , or even more , have elapse between the time when she have hear the voice and 5 o'clock , when she have take tea to she mistress .
the inquest be hold on Friday at the Stylites arm in the village .
Poirot and I sit together , not be require to give evidence .
the preliminary be go through .
the jury view the body , and John Cavendish give evidence of identification .
further question , he describe he awakening in the early hour of the morning , and the circumstance of he mother 's death .
the medical evidence be next take .
there be a breathless hush , and every eye be fix on the famous London specialist , who be know to be one of the greatest authority of the day on the subject of toxicology .
in a few brief word , he sum up the result of the post-mortem .
shear of its medical phraseology and technicality , it amount to the fact that mr.s . inglethorp have meet she death as the result of strychnine poisoning .
judge from the quantity recover , she must have take not less than three-quarter of a grain of strychnine , but probably one grain or slightly over .
be it possible that she could have swallow the poison by accident ? ask the Coroner .
I should consider it very unlikely .
Strychnine be not use for domestic purpose , as some poison be , and there be restriction place on its sale .
Does anything in you examination lead you to determine how the poison be administer ?
no .
you arrive at style before Dr Wilkins , I believe ?
that be so .
the motor meet I just outside the lodge gate , and I hurry there as fast as I could .
will you relate to we exactly what happen next ?
I enter mr.s . Inglethorp 's room .
she be at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion .
she turn towards I , and gasp out : alfred.alfred . . ' .
could the strychnine have be administer in mr.s . Inglethorp 's after-dinner coffee which be take to she by she husband ?
possibly , but strychnine be a fairly rapid drug in its action .
the symptom appear from one to two hour after it have be swallow .
it be retard under certain condition , none of which , however , appear to have be present in this case .
I presume mr.s . Inglethorp take the coffee after dinner about eight o'clock , whereas the symptom do not manifest themselves until the early hour of the morning , which , on the face of it , point to the drug have be take much later in the evening .
mr.s . inglethorp be in the habit of drink a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night .
could the strychnine have be administer in that ?
no , I myself take a sample of the cocoa remain in the saucepan and have it analyse .
there be no strychnine present .
I hear Poirot chuckle softly beside I .
how do you know ?
I whisper .
listen .
I should say . the doctor be continue . that I would have be considerably surprise at any other result .
why ?
simply because strychnine have a unusually bitter taste .
it can be detect in a solution of 1 in 70,000 , and can only be disguise by some strongly flavoured substance .
Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it .
one of the jury want to know if the same objection apply to coffee .
no .
Coffee have a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine .
then you consider it more likely that the drug be administer in the coffee , but that for some unknown reason its action be delay .
yes , but , the cup be completely smash , there be no possibility of analyze its contents .
this conclude Dr Bauerstein 's evidence .
Dr Wilkins corroborate it on all point .
sound as to the possibility of suicide , he repudiate it utterly .
the decease , he say , suffer from a weak heart , but otherwise enjoy perfect health , and be of a cheerful and well-balanced disposition .
she would be one of the last people to take she own life .
Lawrence Cavendish be next call .
he evidence be quite unimportant , be a mere repetition of that of he brother .
just as he be about to step down , he pause , and say rather hesitatingly : I should like to make a suggestion if I may ?
he glance deprecatingly at the Coroner , who reply briskly : certainly , Mr. Cavendish , we be here to arrive at the truth of this matter , and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation .
it be just a idea of mine , explain Lawrence .
of course i may be quite wrong , but it still seem to I that my mother 's death might be account for by natural means .
how do you make that out , Mr. Cavendish ?
my mother , at the time of she death , and for some time before it , be take a tonic contain strychnine .
ah ! say the Coroner .
the jury look up , interested .
I believe , continue Lawrence , that there have be case where the cumulative effect of a drug , administer for some time , have end by cause death .
also , be it not possible that she may have take a overdose of she medicine by accident ?
this be the first we have hear of the deceased take strychnine at the time of she death .
we be much oblige to you , Mr. Cavendish .
Dr Wilkins be recall and ridicule the idea .
what Mr. Cavendish suggest be quite impossible .
any doctor would tell you the same .
Strychnine be , in a certain sense , a cumulative poison , but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way .
there would have to be a long period of chronic symptom which would at once have attract my attention .
the whole thing be absurd .
and the second suggestion ?
that mr.s . inglethorp may have inadvertently take a overdose ?
three , or even four dose , would not have result in death .
mr.s . inglethorp always have a extra large amount of medicine make up at a time , as she deal with coot 's , the cash chemist in Tadminster .
she would have have to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine find at the post-mortem .
then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not be in any way instrumental in cause she death ?
certainly .
the supposition be ridiculous .
the same juryman who have interrupt before here suggest that the chemist who make up the medicine might have commit a error .
that , of course , be always possible , reply the doctor .
but Dorcas , who be the next witness call , dispel even that possibility .
the medicine have not be newly make up .
on the contrary , mr.s . inglethorp have take the last dose on the day of she death .
so the question of the tonic be finally abandon , and the Coroner proceed with he task .
have elicit from Dorcas how she have be awaken by the violent ringing of she mistress 's bell , and have subsequently rouse the household , he pass to the subject of the quarrel on the precede afternoon .
Dorcas 's evidence on this point be substantially what Poirot and I have already hear , so I will not repeat it here .
the next witness be Mary Cavendish .
she stand very upright , and speak in a low , clear , and perfectly compose voice .
in answer to the Coroner 's question , she tell how , she alarm clock have arouse she at 4.30 .
as usual , she be dress , when she be startle by the sound of something heavy fall .
that would have be the table by the bed ?
comment the Coroner .
I open my door , continue Mary , and listen .
in a few minute a bell ring violently .
Dorcas come run down and wake my husband , and we all go to my mother-in-law 's mother-in-law 's room , but it be lock . .
the coroner interrupt she .
I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point .
we know all that can be know of the subsequent happening .
but I should be oblige if you would tell we all you overhear of the quarrel the day before .
I ?
there be a faint insolence in she voice .
she raise she hand and adjust the ruffle of lace at she neck , turn she head a little as she do so .
and quite spontaneously the thought flash across my mind : she be gain time !
yes .
I understand , continue the Coroner deliberately , that you be sit reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir .
that be so , be it not ?
this be news to I and glance sideways at Poirot , I fancy that it be news to he as well .
there be the faintest pause , the mere hesitation of a moment , before she answer : yes , that be so .
and the boudoir window be open , be it not ?
surely she face grow a little paler as she answer : yes .
then you can not have fail to hear the voice inside , especially as they be raise in anger .
in fact , they would be more audible where you be than in the hall .
possibly .
will you repeat to we what you overhear of the quarrel ?
I really do not remember hearing anything .
do you mean to say you do not hear voice ?
oh , yes , I hear the voice , but I do not hear what they say .
a faint spot of colour come into she cheek .
I be not in the habit of listen to private conversation .
the Coroner persist .
and you remember nothing at all ?
nothing , mr.s . Cavendish ?
not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it be a private conversation ?
she pause , and seem to reflect , still outwardly as calm as ever .
yes ; I remember .
mr.s . Inglethorp say something.i do not remember exactly what.about cause scandal between husband and wife .
ah !
the Coroner lean back satisfied .
that correspond with what Dorcas hear .
but excuse I , mr.s . Cavendish , although you realize it be a private conversation , you do not move away ?
you remain where you be ?
I catch the momentary gleam of she tawny eye as she raise they .
I feel certain that at that moment she would willingly have tear the little lawyer , with he insinuation , into piece , but she reply quietly enough : no .
I be very comfortable where I be .
I fix my mind on my book .
and that be all you can tell we ?
that be all .
the examination be over , though I doubt if the Coroner be entirely satisfy with it .
I think he suspect that Mary Cavendish could tell more if she choose .
Amy Hill , shop assistant , be next call , and depose to have sell a will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl , under-gardener at style .
William Earl and Manning succeed she , and testify to witness a document .
Manning fix the time at about 4.30 , .
William be of the opinion that it be rather earlier .
Cynthia Murdoch come next .
she have , however , little to tell .
she have know nothing of the tragedy , until awaken by mr.s . Cavendish .
you do not hear the table fall ?
no .
I be fast asleep .
the Coroner smile .
a good conscience make a sound sleeper , he observe .
thank you , Miss Murdoch , that be all .
Miss Howard .
Miss Howard produce the letter write to she by mr.s . inglethorp on the evening of the 17th .
Poirot and I have , of course already see it .
it add nothing to we knowledge of the tragedy .
the following be a facsimile : style COURT ESSEX hand write note : July 17th my dear Evelyn , can we not bury the hachet ?
I have find it hard to forgive the thing you say against my dear husband but I be a old woman & very fond of you , Yours affectionately , Emily Inglethorpe it be hand to the jury who scrutinize it attentively .
I fear it do not help we much , say the Coroner , with a sigh .
there be no mention of any of the event of that afternoon .
plain as a pikestaff to I , say Miss Howard shortly .
it show clearly enough that my poor old friend have just find out she have be make a fool of !
it say nothing of the kind in the letter , the Coroner point out .
no , because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong .
but I know she .
she want I back .
but she be not go to own that I would be right .
she go round about .
most people do .
do not believe in it myself .
Mr. Wells smile faintly .
so , I notice , do several of the jury .
Miss Howard be obviously quite a public character .
anyway , all this tomfoolery be a great waste of time , continue the lady , glance up and down the jury disparagingly .
talk.talk.talk !
when all the time we know perfectly well . .
the coroner interrupt she in a agony of apprehension : thank you , Miss Howard , that be all .
I fancy he breathe a sigh of relief when she comply .
then come the sensation of the day .
the Coroner call Albert Mace , chemist 's assistant .
it be we agitate young man of the pale face .
in answer to the Coroner 's question , he explain that he be a qualify pharmacist , but have only recently come to this particular shop , as the assistant formerly there have just be call up for the army .
these preliminary complete , the Coroner proceed to business .
Mr. Mace , have you lately sell strychnine to any unauthorized person ?
yes , sir .
when be this ?
last Monday night .
Monday ?
not Tuesday ?
no , sir , Monday , the 16th .
will you tell we to whom you sell it ?
you could have hear a pin drop .
yes , sir .
it be to Mr. Inglethorp .
every eye turn simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp be sit , impassive and wooden .
he start slightly , as the damning word fall from the young man 's lip .
I half think he be go to rise from he chair , but he remain seat , although a remarkably well act expression of astonishment rise on he face .
you be sure of what you say ? ask the Coroner sternly .
quite sure , sir .
be you in the habit of sell strychnine indiscriminately over the counter ?
the wretched young man wilt visibly under the Coroner 's frown .
oh , no , sir.of sir.of course not .
but , see it be Mr. Inglethorp of the Hall , I think there be no harm in it .
he say it be to poison a dog .
inwardly I sympathize .
it be only human nature to endeavour to please ` the Hall ' . especially when it might result in custom be transfer from Coot 's to the local establishment .
be it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book ?
yes , sir , Mr. Inglethorp do so .
have you get the book here ?
yes , sir .
it be produce ; and , with a few word of stern censure , the Coroner dismiss the wretched Mr. Mace .
then , amidst a breathless silence , Alfred Inglethorp be call .
do he realize , I wonder , how closely the halter be be draw around he neck ?
the Coroner go straight to the point .
on Monday evening last , do you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog ?
Inglethorp reply with perfect calmness : no , I do not .
there be no dog at style , except a outdoor sheepdog , which be in perfect health .
you deny absolutely have purchase strychnine from Albert Mace on Monday last ?
I do .
do you also deny this ?
the Coroner hand he the register in which he signature be inscribe .
certainly I do .
the hand-writing be quite different from mine .
I will show you .
he take a old envelope out of he pocket , and write he name on it , hand it to the jury .
it be certainly utterly dissimilar .
then what be you explanation of Mr. Mace 's statement ?
Alfred Inglethorp reply imperturbably : Mr. Mace must have be mistake .
the Coroner hesitate for a moment , and then say : Mr. Inglethorp , as a mere matter of form , would you mind tell we where you be on the evening of Monday , July 16th ?
really.i can not remember .
that be absurd , Mr. Inglethorp , say the Coroner sharply .
think again .
Inglethorp shake he head .
I can not tell you .
I have a idea that I be out walk .
in what direction ?
I really can not remember .
the Coroner 's face grow graver .
be you in company with anyone ?
no .
do you meet anyone on you walk ?
no .
that be a pity , say the Coroner dryly .
I be to take it then that you decline to say where you be at the time that Mr. Mace positively recognize you as enter the shop to purchase strychnine ?
if you like to take it that way , yes .
be careful , Mr. Inglethorp .
Poirot be fidget nervously .
sacre !
he murmur .
do this imbecile of a man want to be arrest ?
Inglethorp be indeed create a bad impression .
he futile denial would not have convince a child .
the Coroner , however , pass briskly to the next point , and Poirot draw a deep breath of relief .
you have a discussion with you wife on Tuesday afternoon ?
pardon I , interrupted Alfred Inglethorp , you have be misinform .
I have no quarrel with my dear wife .
the whole story be absolutely untrue .
I be absent from the house the entire afternoon .
have you anyone who can testify to that ?
you have my word , say Inglethorp haughtily .
the Coroner do not trouble to reply .
there be two witness who will swear to have hear you disagreement with mr.s . inglethorp .
those witness be mistake .
I be puzzle .
the man speak with such quiet assurance that I be stagger .
I look at Poirot .
there be a expression of exultation on he face which I could not understand .
be he at last convinced of Alfred Inglethorp 's guilt ?
Mr. Inglethorp , say the Coroner , you have hear you wife 's die word repeat here .
can you explain they in any way ?
certainly I can .
you can ?
it seem to I very simple .
the room be dimly light .
Dr Bauerstein be much of my height and build , and , like I , wear a beard .
in the dim light , and suffer as she be , my poor wife mistake he for I .
ah !
Murmured Poirot to himself .
but it be a idea , that !
you think it be true ?
I whisper .
I do not say that .
but it be truly a ingenious supposition .
you read my wife 's last word as a accusation . inglethorp be continue . they be , on the contrary , a appeal to I .
the Coroner reflect a moment , then he say : I believe , Mr. Inglethorp , that you yourself pour out the coffee , and take it to you wife that evening ?
I pour it out , yes .
but I do not take it to she .
I mean to do so , but I be tell that a friend be at the hall door , so I lay down the coffee on the hall table .
when I come through the hall again a few minute later , it be go .
this statement might , or might not , be true , but it do not seem to I to improve matter much for Inglethorp .
in any case , he have have ample time to introduce the poison .
at that point , Poirot nudge I gently , indicate two man who be sit together near the door .
one be a little , sharp , dark , ferret-faced man , the other be tall and fair .
I question Poirot mutely .
he put he lip to my ear .
do you know who that little man be ?
I shake my head .
that be Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard.Jimmy Japp .
the other man be from Scotland Yard too .
thing be move quickly , my friend .
I stare at the two man intently .
there be certainly nothing of the policeman about they .
I should never have suspect they of be official personage .
I be still stare , when I be startle and recall by the verdict be give : wilful murder against some person or person unknown .
as we come out of the Stylites arm , Poirot draw I aside by a gentle pressure of the arm .
I understand he object .
he be wait for the Scotland Yard man .
in a few moment , they emerge , and Poirot at once step forward , and accost the shorter of the two .
I fear you do not remember I , Inspector Japp .
why , if it be not Mr. Poirot ! cry the Inspector .
he turn to the other man .
you have hear I speak of Mr. Poirot ?
it be in 1904 he and I work together.the Abercrombie forgery case.you remember , he be run down in Brussels .
ah , those be great day , moosier .
then , do you remember ` Baron ' Altara ?
there be a pretty rogue for you !
he elude the clutch of half the police in Europe .
but we nail he in antwerp.thanks to Mr. Poirot here .
as these friendly reminiscence be be indulge in , I draw nearer , and be introduce to Detective-Inspector Japp , who , in he turn , introduce we both to he companion , Superintendent Summerhaye .
I need hardly ask what you be do here , gentleman , remark Poirot .
Japp close one eye knowingly .
no , indeed .
Pretty clear case I should say .
but Poirot answer gravely : there I differ from you .
oh , come ! say Summerhaye , open he lip for the first time .
surely the whole thing be clear as daylight .
the man 's catch red-handed .
how he could be such a fool beat I !
but Japp be look attentively at Poirot .
hold you fire , Summerhaye , he remark jocularly .
I and Moosier here have meet before.and there be no man 's judgment I would sooner take than he .
if I be not greatly mistaken , he be get something up he sleeve .
be not that so , moosier ?
Poirot smile .
I have draw certain conclusions.yes .
Summerhaye be still look rather sceptical , but Japp continue he scrutiny of Poirot .
it be this way , he say , so far , we have only see the case from the outside .
that be where the yard 's at a disadvantage in a case of this kind , where the murder 's only out , so to speak , after the inquest .
a lot depend on be on the spot first thing , and that be where Mr. Poirot 's have the start of we .
we should not have be here as soon as this even , if it have not be for the fact that there be a smart doctor on the spot , who give we the tip through the Coroner .
but you have be on the spot from the first , and you may have pick up some little hint .
from the evidence at the inquest , Mr. Inglethorp murder he wife as sure as I stand here , and if anyone but you hint the contrary I would laugh in he face .
I must say I be surprise the jury do not bring it in Wilful murder against he right off .
I think they would have , if it have not be for the coroner.he seem to be hold they back .
perhaps , though , you have a warrant for he arrest in you pocket now , suggest Poirot .
a kind of wooden shutter of officialdom come down from Japp 's expressive countenance .
perhaps I have , and perhaps I have not , he remark dryly .
Poirot look at he thoughtfully .
I be very anxious , Messieurs , that he should not be arrest .
I dare say , observe Summerhaye sarcastically .
Japp be regard Poirot with comical perplexity .
can not you go a little further , Mr. Poirot ?
a wink 's as good as a nod.from you .
you have be on the spot.and the yard do not want to make any mistake , you know .
Poirot nod gravely .
that be exactly what I think .
well , I will tell you this .
use you warrant : arrest Mr. Inglethorp .
but it will bring you no kudos.the kudos.the case against he will be dismiss at once !
Comme can !
and he snap he finger expressively .
Japp 's face grow grave , though Summerhaye give a incredulous snort .
as for I , I be literally dumb with astonishment .
I could only conclude that Poirot be mad .
Japp have take out a handkerchief , and be gently dab he brow .
I dare not do it , Mr. Poirot .
I would take you word , but there be other over I who will be ask what the devil I mean by it .
can not you give I a little more to go on ?
Poirot reflect a moment .
it can be do , he say at last .
I admit I do not wish it .
it force my hand .
I would have prefer to work in the dark just for the present , but what you say be very just.the word of a belgian policeman , whose day be past , be not enough !
and Alfred Inglethorp must not be arrest .
that I have swear , as my friend Hastings here know .
see , then , my good japp , you go at once to style ?
well , in about half a hour .
we be see the Coroner and the doctor first .
good .
call for I in passing.the last house in the village .
I will go with you .
at style , Mr. Inglethorp will give you , or if he refuses.as be probable.i probable.i will give you such proof that shall satisfy you that the case against he could not possibly be sustain .
be that a bargain ?
that be a bargain , say Japp heartily .
and , on behalf of the yard , I be much oblige to you , though I be bind to confess I can not at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence , but you always be a marvel !
so long , then , moosier .
the two detective stride away , summerhaye with a incredulous grin on he face .
well , my friend , cry Poirot , before I could get in a word , what do you think ?
Mon Dieu !
I have some warm moment in that court ; I do not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all .
decidedly , it be the policy of a imbecile .
h be !
there be other explanation besides that of imbecility , I remark .
for , if the case against he be true , how could he defend himself except by silence ?
why , in a thousand ingenious way , cry Poirot .
see ; say that it be I who have commit this murder , I can think of seven most plausible story !
far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp 's stony denial !
I could not help laughing .
my dear Poirot , I be sure you be capable of thinking of seventy !
but , seriously , in spite of what I hear you say to the detective , you surely can not still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp 's innocence ?
why not now as much as before ?
nothing have change .
but the evidence be so conclusive .
yes , too conclusive .
we turn in at the gate of Leastways Cottage , and proceed up the now familiar stair .
yes , yes , too conclusive , continue Poirot , almost to himself .
real evidence be usually vague and unsatisfactory .
it have to be examined.sifted .
but here the whole thing be cut and dry .
no , my friend , this evidence have be very cleverly manufactured.so cleverly that it have defeat its own end .
how do you make that out ?
because , so long as the evidence against he be vague and intangible , it be very hard to disprove .
but , in he anxiety , the criminal have draw the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free .
I be silent .
and in a minute or two , Poirot continue : let we look at the matter like this .
here be a man , let we say , who set out to poison he wife .
he have live by he wit as the say go .
presumably , therefore , he have some wit .
he be not altogether a fool .
well , how do he set about it ?
he go boldly to the village chemist 's and purchase strychnine under he own name , with a trump up story about a dog which be bind to be prove absurd .
he do not employ the poison that night .
no , he wait until he have have a violent quarrel with she , of which the whole household be cognisant , and which naturally direct they suspicion upon he .
he prepare no defence.no shadow of a alibi , yet he know the chemist 's assistant must necessarily come forward with the fact .
Bah !
do not ask I to believe that any man could be so idiotic !
only a lunatic , who wish to commit suicide by cause himself to be hang , would act so !
still.i do not see . I begin .
neither do I see .
I tell you , mon ami , it puzzle I .
Me.Hercule Poirot !
but if you believe he innocent , how do you explain he buy the strychnine ?
very simply .
he do not buy it .
but Mace recognize he !
I beg you pardon , he see a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp 's , and wear glass like Mr. Inglethorp , and dress in Mr. Inglethorp 's rather noticeable clothes .
he could not recognize a man whom he have probably only see in the distance , since , you remember , he himself have only be in the village a fortnight , and mr.s . inglethorp deal principally with coot 's in Tadminster .
then you think . .
Mon ami , do you remember the two point I lay stress upon ?
leave the first one for the moment , what be the second ?
the important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wear peculiar clothes , have a black beard , and use glass , I quote .
exactly .
now suppose anyone wish to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish .
would it be easy ?
no , I say thoughtfully .
of course a actor . . but Poirot cut I short ruthlessly .
and why would it not be easy ?
I will tell you , my friend : because they be both clean-shaven man .
to make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight , it would need a actor of genius , and a certain initial facial resemblance .
but in the case of Alfred Inglethorp , all that be change .
he clothes , he beard , the glass which hide he eyes.those be the salient point about he personal appearance .
now , what be the first instinct of the criminal ?
to divert suspicion from himself , be it not so ?
and how can he best do that ?
by throw it on some one else .
in this instance , there be a man ready to he hand .
everybody be predispose to believe in Mr. Inglethorp 's guilt .
it be a foregone conclusion that he would be suspect ; but , to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof.such as the actual buying of the poison , and that , with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr. Inglethorp , be not difficult .
remember , this young Mace have never actually speak to Mr. Inglethorp .
how should he doubt that the man in he clothes , with he beard and he glass , be not Alfred Inglethorp ?
it may be so , I say , fascinate by Poirot 's eloquence .
but , if that be the case , why do he not say where he be at six o'clock on Monday evening ?
ah , why indeed ? say Poirot , calming down .
if he be arrest , he probably would speak , but I do not want it to come to that .
I must make he see the gravity of he position .
there be , of course , something discreditable behind he silence .
if he do not murder he wife , he be , nevertheless , a scoundrel , and have something of he own to conceal , quite apart from the murder .
what can it be ?
I muse , win over to Poirot 's view for the moment , although still retain a faint conviction that the obvious deduction be the correct one .
can you not guess ? ask Poirot , smile .
no , can you ?
oh , yes , I have a little idea sometime ago.and it have turn out to be correct .
you never tell I , I say reproachfully .
Poirot spread out he hand apologetically .
pardon I , mon ami , you be not precisely sympathique .
he turn to I earnestly .
tell me.you see now that he must not be arrest ?
perhaps , I say doubtfully , for I be really quite indifferent to the fate of Alfred Inglethorp , and think that a good fright would do he no harm .
Poirot , who be watch I intently , give a sigh .
come , my friend , he say , change the subject , apart from Mr. Inglethorp , how do the evidence at the inquest strike you ?
oh , pretty much what I expect .
do nothing strike you as peculiar about it ?
my thought fly to Mary Cavendish , and I hedge : in what way ?
well , Mr. Lawrence Cavendish 's evidence for instance ?
I be relieve .
oh , Lawrence !
no , I do not think so .
he be always a nervous chap .
he suggestion that he mother might have be poison accidentally by means of the tonic she be take , that do not strike you as strange.hein ?
no , I can not say it do .
the doctor ridicule it of course .
but it be quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make .
but Monsieur Lawrence be not a layman .
you tell I yourself that he have start by study medicine , and that he have take he degree .
yes , that be true .
I never think of that .
I be rather startle .
it be odd .
Poirot nod .
from the first , he behaviour have be peculiar .
of all the household , he alone would be likely to recognize the symptom of strychnine poisoning , and yet we find he the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural cause .
if it have be Monsieur John , I could have understand it .
he have no technical knowledge , and be by nature unimaginative .
but Monsieur Lawrence.no !
and now , today , he put forward a suggestion that he himself must have know be ridiculous .
there be food for think in this , mon ami !
it be very confusing , I agree .
then there be mr.s . Cavendish , continue Poirot .
that be another who be not tell all she know !
what do you make of she attitude ?
I do not know what to make of it .
it seem inconceivable that she should be shield Alfred Inglethorp .
yet that be what it look like .
Poirot nod reflectively .
yes , it be queer .
one thing be certain , she overhear a good deal more of that ` private conversation ' than she be willing to admit .
and yet she be the last person one would accuse of stoop to eavesdrop !
exactly .
one thing she evidence have show I .
I make a mistake .
Dorcas be quite right .
the quarrel do take place earlier in the afternoon , about four o'clock , as she say .
I look at he curiously .
I have never understand he insistence on that point .
yes , a good deal that be peculiar come out today , continue Poirot .
Dr Bauerstein , now , what be he do up and dress at that hour in the morning ?
it be astonishing to I that no one comment on the fact .
he have insomnia , I believe , I say doubtfully .
which be a very good , or a very bad explanation , remark Poirot .
it cover everything , and explain nothing .
I shall keep my eye on we clever dr bauerstein .
any more fault to find with the evidence ?
I inquire satirically .
Mon ami , reply Poirot gravely , when you find that people be not tell you the truth.look out !
now , unless I be much mistaken , at the inquest today only one.at most , two person be speak the truth without reservation or subterfuge .
oh , come now , Poirot !
I will not cite Lawrence , or mr.s . Cavendish .
but there be John.and Miss Howard , surely they be speak the truth ?
both of they , my friend ?
one , I grant you , but both . . !
he word give I a unpleasant shock .
Miss Howard 's evidence , unimportant as it be , have be give in such a downright straightforward manner that it have never occur to I to doubt she sincerity .
still , I have a great respect for Poirot 's sagacity.except on the occasion when he be what I describe to myself as foolishly pig-headed .
do you really think so ? I ask .
Miss Howard have always seem to I so essentially honest.almost uncomfortably so .
Poirot give I a curious look , which I could not quite fathom .
he seem to speak , and then check himself .
Miss Murdoch too , I continue , there be nothing untruthful about she .
no .
but it be strange that she never hear a sound , sleep next door ; whereas mr.s . Cavendish , in the other wing of the building , distinctly hear the table fall .
well , she be young .
and she sleep soundly .
ah , yes , indeed !
she must be a famous sleeper , that one !
I do not quite like the tone of he voice , but at that moment a smart knock reach we ear , and look out of the window we perceive the two detective wait for we below .
poirot seize he hat , give a ferocious twist to he moustache , and , carefully brushing a imaginary speck of dust from he sleeve , motion I to precede he down the stair ; there we join the detective and set out for style .
I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard man be rather a shock.especially to John , though of course after the verdict , he have realize that it be only a matter of time .
still , the presence of the detective bring the truth home to he more than anything else could have do .
Poirot have confer with japp in a low tone on the way up , and it be the latter functionary who request that the household , with the exception of the servant , should be assemble together in the drawing-room .
I realize the significance of this .
it be up to Poirot to make he boast good .
personally , I be not sanguine .
Poirot might have excellent reason for he belief in Inglethorp 's innocence , but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proof , and these I doubt if Poirot could supply .
before very long we have all troop into the drawing-room , the door of which Japp close .
Poirot politely set chair for every one .
the Scotland Yard man be the cynosure of all eye .
I think that for the first time we realize that the thing be not a bad dream , but a tangible reality .
we have read of such things.now we ourselves be actor in the drama .
tomorrow the daily papers , all over England , would blazon out the news in stare headline : mysterious tragedy in ESSEX WEALTHY lady poison .
there would be picture of style , snap-shot of the family leave the Inquest . the village photographer have not be idle !
all the thing that one have read a hundred time , thing that happen to other people , not to oneself .
and now , in this house , a murder have be commit .
in front of we be the detective in charge of the case .
the well-known glib phraseology pass rapidly through my mind in the interval before Poirot open the proceedings .
I think every one be a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detective who take the initiative .
mesdame and monsieur , say Poirot , bow as though he be a celebrity about to deliver a lecture , I have ask you to come here all together , for a certain object .
that object , it concern Mr. Alfred Inglethorp .
Inglethorp be sit a little by himself.i think , unconsciously , every one have draw he chair slightly away from him.and he give a faint start as Poirot pronounce he name .
Mr. Inglethorp , say Poirot , address he directly , a very dark shadow be rest on this house.the shadow of murder .
Inglethorp shake he head sadly .
my poor wife , he murmur .
Poor Emily !
it be terrible .
I do not think , monsieur , say Poirot pointedly , that you quite realize how terrible it may be.for you .
and as Inglethorp do not appear to understand , he add : Mr. Inglethorp , you be stand in very grave danger .
the two detective fidget .
I see the official caution anything you say will be use in evidence against you , actually hover on Summerhaye 's lip .
Poirot go on .
do you understand now , monsieur ?
no ; what do you mean ?
I mean , say Poirot deliberately , that you be suspect of poisoning you wife .
a little gasp run round the circle at this plain speaking .
good heaven ! cry Inglethorp , start up .
what a monstrous idea !
i.poison my dearest Emily !
I do not think . poirot watch he narrowly . that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of you evidence at the inquest .
Mr. Inglethorp , know what I have now tell you , do you still refuse to say where you be at six o'clock on Monday afternoon ?
with a groan , Alfred Inglethorp sink down again and bury he face in he hand .
Poirot approach and stand over he .
speak ! he cry menacingly .
with a effort , Inglethorp raise he face from he hand .
then , slowly and deliberately , he shake he head .
you will not speak ?
no .
I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse I of what you say .
Poirot nod thoughtfully , like a man whose mind be make up .
soit ! he say .
then I must speak for you .
Alfred Inglethorp spring up again .
you ?
how can you speak ?
you do not know . . he break off abruptly .
Poirot turn to face we .
mesdame and monsieur !
I speak !
listen !
I , Hercule Poirot , affirm that the man who enter the chemist 's shop , and purchase strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last be not Mr. Inglethorp , for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp be escort mr.s . Raikes back to she home from a neighbouring farm .
I can produce no less than five witness to swear to have see they together , either at six or just after and , as you may know , the Abbey Farm , Mr.s . Raikes 's home , be at least two and a half mile distant from the village .
there be absolutely no question as to the alibi !
there be a moment 's stupefied silence .
Japp , who be the least surprised of any of we , be the first to speak .
my word , he cry , you be the goods !
and no mistake , Mr. Poirot !
these witness of yours be all right , I suppose ?
Voila !
I have prepare a list of them.names and address .
you must see they , of course .
but you will find it all right .
I be sure of that .
japp lower he voice .
I be much oblige to you .
a pretty mare 's nest arrest he would have be .
he turn to Inglethorp .
but , if you will excuse I , sir , why could not you say all this at the inquest ?
I will tell you why , interrupted Poirot .
there be a certain rumour . .
a most malicious and utterly untrue one , interrupted Alfred Inglethorp in a agitate voice .
and Mr. Inglethorp be anxious to have no scandal revive just at present .
be I right ?
quite right .
Inglethorp nod .
with my poor Emily not yet bury , can you wonder I be anxious that no more lie rumour should be start .
between you and I , sir , remark Japp , I would sooner have any amount of rumour than be arrest for murder .
and I venture to think you poor lady would have feel the same .
and , if it have not be for Mr. Poirot here , arrest you would have be , as sure as egg be egg !
I be foolish , no doubt , murmur Inglethorp .
but you do not know , inspector , how I have be persecute and malign .
and he shoot a baleful glance at Evelyn Howard .
now , sir , say Japp , turn briskly to John , I should like to see the lady 's bedroom , please , and after that I will have a little chat with the servant .
do not you bother about anything .
Mr. Poirot , here , will show I the way .
as they all go out of the room , Poirot turn and make I a sign to follow he upstairs .
there he catch I by the arm , and draw I aside .
quick , go to the other wing .
stand there.just this side of the baize door .
do not move till I come .
then , turn rapidly , he rejoin the two detective .
I follow he instruction , take up my position by the baize door , and wonder what on earth lay behind the request .
why be I to stand in this particular spot on guard ?
I look thoughtfully down the corridor in front of I .
a idea strike I .
with the exception of Cynthia Murdoch 's , every one 's room be in this left wing .
have that anything to do with it ?
be I to report who come or go ?
I stand faithfully at my post .
the minute pass .
nobody come .
nothing happen .
it must have be quite twenty minute before Poirot rejoin I .
you have not stir ?
no , I have stick here like a rock .
nothing 's happen .
ah !
be he please , or disappoint ?
you have see nothing at all ?
no .
but you have probably hear something ?
a big bump.eh , mon ami ?
no .
be it possible ?
ah , but I be vex with myself !
I be not usually clumsy .
I make but a slight gesture . I know Poirot 's gesture . with the left hand , and over go the table by the bed !
he look so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hasten to console he .
never mind , old chap .
what do it matter ?
you triumph downstairs excite you .
I can tell you , that be a surprise to we all .
there must be more in this affair of Inglethorp 's with mr.s . Raikes than we think , to make he hold he tongue so persistently .
what be you go to do now ?
where be the Scotland Yard fellow ?
go down to interview the servant .
I show they all we exhibit .
I be disappoint in Japp .
he have no method !
Hullo !
Hullo ! say , look out of the window .
here be Dr Bauerstein .
I believe you be right about that man , Poirot .
I do not like he .
he be clever , observe Poirot meditatively .
oh , clever as the devil !
I must say I be overjoy to see he in the plight he be in on Tuesday .
you never see such a spectacle !
and I describe the doctor 's adventure .
he look a regular scarecrow !
plaster with mud from head to foot .
you see he , then ?
yes .
of course , he do not want to come in.it be just after dinner.but Mr. Inglethorp insist .
what ?
Poirot catch I violently by the shoulder .
be Dr Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening ?
here ?
and you never tell I ?
why do you not tell I ?
why ?
why ?
he appear to be in a absolute frenzy .
my dear Poirot , I expostulate , I never think it would interest you .
I do not know it be of any importance .
importance ?
it be of the first importance !
so drbauerstein be here on Tuesday night.the night of the murder .
Hastings , do you not see ?
that alter everything.everything !
I have never see he so upset .
loosen he hold of I , he mechanically straighten a pair of candlestick , still murmur to himself : yes , that alter everything.everything .
suddenly he seem to come to a decision .
Allons ! he say .
we must act at once .
where be Mr. Cavendish ?
John be in the smoking-room .
Poirot go straight to he .
Mr. Cavendish , I have some important business in Tadminster .
a new clue .
may I take you motor ?
why , of course .
do you mean at once ?
if you please .
John ring the bell , and order round the car .
in another ten minute , we be race down the park and along the high road to Tadminster .
now , Poirot , I remark resignedly , perhaps you will tell I what all this be about ?
well , mon ami , a good deal you can guess for yourself .
of course you realize that , now Mr. Inglethorp be out of it , the whole position be greatly change .
we be face to face with a entirely new problem .
we know now that there be one person who do not buy the poison .
we have clear away the manufacture clue .
now for the real one .
I have ascertain that anyone in the household , with the exception of mr.s . Cavendish , who be play tennis with you , could have personate Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening .
in the same way , we have he statement that he put the coffee down in the hall .
no one take much notice of that at the inquest.but now it have a very different significance .
we must find out who do take that coffee to mr.s . inglethorp eventually , or who pass through the hall whilst it be stand there .
from you account , there be only two people whom we can positively say do not go near the coffee.mr.s . Cavendish , and Mademoiselle Cynthia .
yes , that be so .
I feel a inexpressible lighten of the heart .
Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion .
in clear Alfred Inglethorp , continue Poirot , I have be oblige to show my hand sooner than I intend .
as long as I might be think to be pursue he , the criminal would be off he guard .
now , he will be doubly careful .
yes.doubly careful .
he turn to I abruptly .
tell I , Hastings , you yourself.have you no suspicion of anybody ?
I hesitate .
to tell the truth , a idea , wild and extravagant in itself , have once or twice that morning flash through my brain .
I have reject it as absurd , nevertheless it persist .
you could not call it a suspicion , I murmur .
it be so utterly foolish .
come now , urge Poirot encouragingly .
do not fear .
speak you mind .
you should always pay attention to you instinct .
well then , I blurt out , it be absurd.but I suspect Miss Howard of not tell all she know !
Miss Howard ?
Yes.you will laugh at I . . not at all .
why should I ?
I can not help feeling , I continue blunderingly ; that we have rather leave she out of the possible suspect , simply on the strength of she have be away from the place .
but , after all , she be only fifteen mile away .
a car would do it in half a hour .
can we say positively that she be away from style on the night of the murder ?
yes , my friend , say Poirot unexpectedly , we can .
one of my first action be to ring up the hospital where she be work .
well ?
well , I learn that Miss Howard have be on afternoon duty on Tuesday , and that.a convoy come in unexpectedly.she have kindly offer to remain on night duty , which offer be gratefully accept .
that dispose of that .
oh ! I say , rather nonplussed .
really , I continue , it be she extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that start I off suspect she .
I can not help feeling she would do anything against he .
and I have a idea she might know something about the destroy of the will .
she might have burn the new one , mistake it for the earlier one in he favour .
she be so terribly bitter against he .
you consider she vehemence unnatural ?
y.es .
she be so very violent .
I wonder really whether she be quite sane on that point .
Poirot shake he head energetically .
no , no , you be on a wrong tack there .
there be nothing weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard .
she be a excellent specimen of well-balanced english beef and brawn .
she be sanity itself .
yet she hatred of Inglethorp seem almost a mania .
my idea was.a very ridiculous one , no doubt.that she have intend to poison him.and that , in some way , mr.s . inglethorp get hold of it by mistake .
but I do not at all see how it could have be do .
the whole thing be absurd and ridiculous to the last degree .
still you be right in one thing .
it be always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically , and to you own satisfaction , that they be innocent .
now , what reason be there against Miss Howard 's have deliberately poison mr.s . Inglethorp ?
why , she be devote to she ! I exclaim .
tcha ! tcha ! cry Poirot irritably .
you argue like a child .
if Miss Howard be capable of poisoning the old lady , she would be quite equally capable of simulate devotion .
no , we must look elsewhere .
you be perfectly correct in you assumption that she vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp be too violent to be natural ; but you be quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it .
I have draw my own deduction , which I believe to be correct , but I will not speak of they at present .
he pause a minute , then go on .
now , to my way of thinking , there be one insuperable objection to Miss Howard 's be the murderess .
and that be ?
that in no possible way could mr.s . Inglethorp 's death benefit Miss Howard .
now there be no murder without a motive .
I reflect .
could not mr.s . inglethorp have make a will in she favour ?
Poirot shake he head .
but you yourself suggest that possibility to Mr. Wells ?
Poirot smile .
that be for a reason .
I do not want to mention the name of the person who be actually in my mind .
Miss Howard occupy very much the same position , so I use she name instead .
still , mr.s . inglethorp might have do so .
why , that will , make on the afternoon of she death may . .
but Poirot 's shake of the head be so energetic that I stop .
no , my friend .
I have certain little idea of my own about that will .
but I can tell you this much.it be not in Miss Howard 's favour .
I accept he assurance , though I do not really see how he could be so positive about the matter .
well , I say , with a sigh , we will acquit Miss Howard , then .
it be partly you fault that I ever come to suspect she .
it be what you say about she evidence at the inquest that set I off .
Poirot look puzzle .
what do I say about she evidence at the inquest ?
do not you remember ?
when I cite she and John Cavendish as be above suspicion ?
oh.ah.yes .
he seem a little confused , but recover himself .
by the way , Hastings , there be something I want you to do for I .
certainly .
what be it ?
next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish , I want you to say this to he .
` I have a message for you , from Poirot .
he say : find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace !
' nothing more .
nothing less .
` find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ' .
be that right ? I ask , much mystified .
excellent .
but what do it mean ?
ah , that I will leave you to find out .
you have access to the fact .
just say that to he , and see what he say .
very well.but it be all extremely mysterious .
we be run into Tadminster now , and Poirot direct the car to the Analytical Chemist .
Poirot hop down briskly , and go inside .
in a few minute he be back again .
there , he say .
that be all my business .
what be you do there ? I ask , in lively curiosity .
I leave something to be analyse .
yes , but what ?
the sample of cocoa I take from the saucepan in the bedroom .
but that have already be test ! I cry , stupefy .
Dr Bauerstein have it test , and you yourself laugh at the possibility of there be strychnine in it .
I know Dr Bauerstein have it test , reply Poirot quietly .
well , then ?
well , I have a fancy for have it analyse again , that be all .
and not another word on the subject could I drag out of he .
this proceeding of Poirot 's , in respect of the cocoa , puzzle I intensely .
I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it .
however , my confidence in he , which at one time have rather wane , be fully restore since he belief in Alfred Inglethorp 's innocence have be so triumphantly vindicate .
the funeral of mr.s . Inglethorp take place the follow day , and on Monday , as I come down to a late breakfast , John draw I aside , and inform I that Mr. Inglethorp be leave that morning , to take up he quarter at the Stylites arm until he should have complete he plan .
and really it be a great relief to think he be go , Hastings , continue my honest friend .
it be bad enough before , when we think he would do it , but I be hang if it be not worse now , when we all feel guilty for have be so down on the fellow .
the fact be , we have treat he abominably .
of course , thing do look black against he .
I do not see how anyone could blame we for jump to the conclusion we do .
still , there it be , we be in the wrong , and now there be a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends ; which be difficult , when one do not like the fellow a bit better than one do before .
the whole thing 's damned awkward !
and I be thankful he be have the tact to take himself off .
it be a good thing style be not the mater 's to leave to he .
could not bear to think of the fellow lord it here .
he be welcome to she money .
you will be able to keep up the place all right ? I ask .
oh , yes .
there be the death duty , of course , but half my father 's money go with the place , and Lawrence will stay with we for the present , so there be he share as well .
we shall be pinch at first , of course , because , as I once tell you , I be in a bit of a hole financially myself .
still , the Johnnies will wait now .
in the general relief at Inglethorp 's approach departure , we have the most genial breakfast we have experience since the tragedy .
Cynthia , whose young spirit be naturally buoyant , be look quite she pretty self again , and we all , with the exception of Lawrence , who seem unalterably gloomy and nervous , be quietly cheerful , at the opening of a new and hopeful future .
the papers , of course , have be full of the tragedy .
glare headline , sandwich biography of every member of the household , subtle innuendo , the usual familiar tag about the police have a clue .
nothing be spare we .
it be a slack time .
the war be momentarily inactive , and the newspaper seize with avidity on this crime in fashionable life : the mysterious Affair at Styles be the topic of the moment .
naturally it be very annoying for the Cavendishes .
the house be constantly besiege by reporter , who be consistently deny admission , but who continue to haunt the village and the grounds , where they lay in wait with camera , for any unwary member of the household .
we all live in a blast of publicity .
the Scotland Yard man come and go , examine , question , lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue .
towards what end they be work , we do not know .
have they any clue , or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crime ?
after breakfast , Dorcas come up to I rather mysteriously , and ask if she might have a few word with I .
certainly .
what be it , Dorcas ?
well , it be just this , sir .
you will be see the belgian gentleman today perhaps ?
I nod .
well , sir , you know how he ask I so particular if the mistress , or anyone else , have a green dress ?
yes , yes .
you have find one ?
my interest be arouse .
no , not that , sir .
but since then I have remember what the young gentleman , John and Lawrence be still the ` young gentleman ' to Dorcas , call the ` dressing-up box . ' .
it be up in the front attic , sir .
a great chest , full of old clothes and fancy dress , and what not .
and it come to I sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst they .
so , if you would tell the belgian gentleman . .
I will tell he , Dorcas , I promise .
thank you very much , sir .
a very nice gentleman he be , sir .
and quite a different class from they two detective from London , what go prying about , and ask question .
I do not hold with foreigner as a rule , but from what the newspaper say I make out as how these brave Belges be not the ordinary run of foreigner , and certainly he be a most polite speak gentleman .
Dear old Dorcas !
as she stand there , with she honest face upturn to mine , I think what a fine specimen she be of the old-fashioned servant that be so fast die out .
I think I might as well go down to the village at once , and look up Poirot ; but I meet he half-way , come up to the house , and at once give he Dorcas 's message .
ah , the brave Dorcas !
we will look at the chest , although.but no matter.we will examine it all the same .
we enter the house by one of the window .
there be no one in the hall , and we go straight up to the attic .
sure enough , there be the chest , a fine old piece , all stud with brass nail , and full to overflow with every imaginable type of garment .
Poirot bundle everything out on the floor with scant ceremony .
there be one or two green fabric of vary shades ; but Poirot shake he head over they all .
he seem somewhat apathetic in the search , as though he expect no great result from it .
suddenly he give a exclamation .
what be it ?
look !
the chest be nearly empty , and there , repose right at the bottom , be a magnificent black beard .
Oho ! say Poirot .
Oho !
he turn it over in he hand , examine it closely .
New , he remark .
yes , quite new .
after a moment 's hesitation , he replace it in the chest , heap all the other thing on top of it as before , and make he way briskly downstairs .
he go straight to the pantry , where we find Dorcas busily polish she silver .
Poirot wish she good morning with gallic politeness , and go on : we have be look through that chest , Dorcas .
I be much oblige to you for mention it .
there be , indeed , a fine collection there .
be they often use , may I ask ?
well , sir , not very often nowadays , though from time to time we do have what the young gentleman call ` a dress-up night . ' .
and very funny it be sometimes , sir .
Mr. Lawrence , he be wonderful .
most comic !
I shall never forget the night he come down as the Char of Persia , I think he call it.a sort of Eastern King it be .
he have the big paper knife in he hand , and ` Mind , Dorcas , ' he say , ` you will have to be very respectful .
this be my specially sharpened scimitar , and it be off with you head if I be at all displeased with you ! ' .
Miss Cynthia , she be what they call a Apache , or some such name.a frenchify sort of cut-throat , I take it to be .
a real sight she look .
you would never have believe a pretty young lady like that could have make herself into such a ruffian .
nobody would have know she .
these evening must have be great fun , say Poirot genially .
I suppose Mr. Lawrence wear that fine black beard in the chest upstairs , when he be Shah of Persia ?
he do have a beard , sir , reply Dorcas , smile .
and well I know it , for he borrow two skein of my black wool to make it with !
and I be sure it look wonderfully natural at a distance .
I do not know as there be a beard up there at all .
it must have be get quite lately , I think .
there be a red wig , I know , but nothing else in the way of hair .
burnt cork they use mostly.though 't be messy get it off again .
Miss Cynthia be a nigger once , and , oh , the trouble she have .
so Dorcas know nothing about that black beard , say Poirot thoughtfully , as we walk out into the hall again .
do you think it be the one ?
I whisper eagerly .
Poirot nod .
I do .
you notice it have be trim ?
no .
yes .
it be cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp 's , and I find one or two snipped hair .
Hastings , this affair be very deep .
who put it in the chest , I wonder ?
some one with a good deal of intelligence , remark Poirot dryly .
you realize that he choose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remark ?
yes , he be intelligent .
but we must be more intelligent .
we must be so intelligent that he do not suspect we of be intelligent at all .
I acquiesce .
there , mon ami , you will be of great assistance to I .
I be please with the compliment .
there have be time when I hardly think that Poirot appreciate I at my true worth .
yes , he continue , stare at I thoughtfully , you will be invaluable .
this be naturally gratifying , but Poirot 's next word be not so welcome .
I must have a ally in the house , he observe reflectively .
you have I , I protest .
true , but you be not sufficient .
I be hurt , and show it .
Poirot hurry to explain himself .
you do not quite take my meaning .
you be know to be work with I .
I want somebody who be not associate with we in any way .
oh , I see .
how about John ?
no , I think not .
the dear fellow be not perhaps very bright , I say thoughtfully .
here come Miss Howard , say Poirot suddenly .
she be the very person .
but I be in she black book , since I clear Mr. Inglethorp .
still , we can but try .
with a nod that be barely civil , Miss Howard assent to Poirot 's request for a few minute ' conversation .
we go into the little morning-room , and Poirot close the door .
well , Monsieur Poirot , say Miss Howard impatiently , what be it ?
out with it .
I be busy .
do you remember , mademoiselle , that I once ask you to help I ?
yes , I do .
the lady nod .
and I tell you I would help you with pleasure.to hang Alfred Inglethorp .
ah !
Poirot study she seriously .
Miss Howard , I will ask you one question .
I beg of you to reply to it truthfully .
never tell lie , reply Miss Howard .
it be this .
do you still believe that mr.s . inglethorp be poison by she husband ?
what do you mean ? she ask sharply .
you need not think you pretty explanation influence I in the slightest .
I will admit that it be not he who buy strychnine at the chemist 's shop .
what of that ?
I dare say he soak fly paper , as I tell you at the beginning .
that be arsenic.not strychnine , say Poirot mildly .
what do that matter ?
arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine .
if I be convinced he do it , it do not matter a jot to I how he do it .
exactly .
if you be convinced he do it , say Poirot quietly .
I will put my question in another form .
do you ever in you heart of heart believe that mr.s . inglethorp be poison by she husband ?
good heaven ! cry Miss Howard .
have not I always tell you the man be a villain ?
have not I always tell you he would murder she in she bed ?
have not I always hate he like poison ?
exactly , say Poirot .
that bear out my little idea entirely .
what little idea ?
Miss Howard , do you remember a conversation that take place on the day of my friend 's arrival here ?
he repeat it to I , and there be a sentence of yours that have impress I very much .
do you remember affirm that if a crime have be commit , and anyone you love have be murder , you feel certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal be , even if you be quite unable to prove it ?
yes , I remember say that .
I believe it too .
I suppose you think it nonsense ?
not at all .
and yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred Inglethorp .
no , say Poirot curtly .
because you instinct be not against Mr. Inglethorp .
what ?
no .
you wish to believe he commit the crime .
you believe he capable of commit it .
but you instinct tell you he do not commit it .
it tell you more.shall I go on ?
she be stare at he , fascinate , and make a slight affirmative movement of the hand .
shall I tell you why you have be so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp ?
it be because you have be try to believe what you wish to believe .
it be because you be try to drown and stifle you instinct , which tell you another name . .
no , no , no ! cry Miss Howard wildly , fling up she hand .
do not say it !
oh , do not say it !
it be not true !
it can not be true .
I do not know what put such a wild.such a dreadful.idea into my head !
I be right , be I not ? ask Poirot .
yes , yes ; you must be a wizard to have guess .
but it can not be so.it 's too monstrous , too impossible .
it must be Alfred Inglethorp .
Poirot shake he head gravely .
do not ask I about it , continue Miss Howard , because I sha not tell you .
I will not admit it , even to myself .
I must be mad to think of such a thing .
Poirot nod , as if satisfy .
I will ask you nothing .
it be enough for I that it be as I think .
and I.I , too , have a instinct .
we be work together towards a common end .
do not ask I to help you , because I will not .
I would not lift a finger to.to . .
she falter .
you will help I in spite of yourself .
I ask you nothing.but you will be my ally .
you will not be able to help yourself .
you will do the only thing that I want of you .
and that be ?
you will watch !
Evelyn Howard bow she head .
yes , I can not help do that .
I be always watching.always hope I shall be prove wrong .
if we be wrong , well and good , say Poirot .
no one will be more pleased than I shall .
but , if we be right ?
if we be right , Miss Howard , on whose side be you then ?
I do not know , I do not know . .
come now .
it could be hush up .
there must be no hush up .
but Emily herself . . she break off .
Miss Howard , say Poirot gravely , this be unworthy of you .
suddenly she take she face from she hand .
yes , she say quietly , that be not Evelyn Howard who speak !
she fling she head up proudly .
this be Evelyn Howard !
and she be on the side of Justice !
let the cost be what it may .
and with these word , she walk firmly out of the room .
there , say Poirot , look after she , go a very valuable ally .
that woman , Hastings , have get brain as well as a heart .
I do not reply .
instinct be a marvellous thing , muse Poirot .
it can neither be explain nor ignore .
you and Miss Howard seem to know what you be talk about , I observe coldly .
perhaps you do not realize that I be still in the dark .
really ?
be that so , mon ami ?
yes .
enlighten I , will you ?
Poirot study I attentively for a moment or two .
then , to my intense surprise , he shake he head decidedly .
no , my friend .
oh , look here , why not ?
two be enough for a secret .
well , I think it be very unfair to keep back fact from I .
I be not keep back fact .
every fact that I know be in you possession .
you can draw you own deduction from they .
this time it be a question of idea .
still , it would be interesting to know .
Poirot look at I very earnestly , and again shake he head .
you see , he say sadly , you have no instinct .
it be intelligence you be require just now , I point out .
the two often go together , say Poirot enigmatically .
the remark seem so utterly irrelevant that I do not even take the trouble to answer it .
but I decide that if I make any interesting and important discoveries.as no doubt I should.i would keep they to myself , and surprise poirot with the ultimate result .
there be time when it be one 's duty to assert oneself .
I have have no opportunity as yet of pass on Poirot 's message to Lawrence .
but now , as I stroll out on the lawn , still nurse a grudge against my friend 's high-handedness , I see Lawrence on the croquet lawn , aimlessly knock a couple of very ancient ball about , with a still more ancient mallet .
it strike I that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message .
otherwise , Poirot himself might relieve I of it .
it be true that I do not quite gather its purport , but I flatter myself that by Lawrence 's reply , and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part , I should soon perceive its significance .
accordingly I accost he .
I have be look for you , I remark untruthfully .
have you ?
yes .
the truth be , I have get a message for you.from Poirot .
yes ?
he tell I to wait until I be alone with you , I say , drop my voice significantly , and watch he intently out of the corner of my eye .
I have always be rather good at what be call , I believe , create a atmosphere .
well ?
there be no change of expression in the dark melancholic face .
have he any idea of what I be about to say ?
this be the message .
I drop my voice still lower .
` find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ' .
what on earth do he mean ?
Lawrence stare at I in quite unaffected astonishment .
do not you know ?
not in the least .
do you ?
I be compel to shake my head .
what extra coffee-cup ?
I do not know .
he would better ask Dorcas , or one of the maid , if he want to know about coffee-cup .
it be they business , not mine .
I do not know anything about the coffee-cup , except that we have get some that be never use , which be a perfect dream !
old Worcester .
you be not a connoisseur , be you , Hastings ?
I shake my head .
you miss a lot .
a really perfect bit of old china.it 's pure delight to handle it , or even to look at it .
well , what be I to tell Poirot ?
tell he I do not know what he be talk about .
it be double dutch to I .
all right .
I be move off towards the house again when he suddenly call I back .
I say , what be the end of that message ?
say it over again , will you ?
` find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ' .
be you sure you do not know what it mean ? I ask he earnestly .
he shake he head .
no , he say musingly , I do not .
I.I wish I do .
the boom of the gong sound from the house , and we go in together .
Poirot have be ask by John to remain to lunch , and be already seat at the table .
by tacit consent , all mention of the tragedy be bar .
we converse on the war , and other outside topic .
but after the cheese and biscuit have be hand round , and Dorcas have leave the room , Poirot suddenly lean forward to mr.s . Cavendish .
pardon I , madame , for recall unpleasant memory , but I have a little idea . Poirot 's little idea be become a perfect byword . and would like to ask one or two question .
of I ?
certainly .
you be too amiable , madame .
what I want to ask be this : the door lead into mr.s . Inglethorp 's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia , it be bolt , you say ?
certainly it be bolt , reply Mary Cavendish , rather surprise . I .
Said so at the inquest .
bolt ?
yes .
she look perplexed .
I mean , explain Poirot , you be sure it be bolt , and not merely lock ?
oh , I see what you mean .
no , I do not know .
I say bolt , mean that it be fasten , and I could not open it , but I believe all the door be find bolt on the inside .
still , as far as you be concerned , the door might equally well have be lock ?
oh , yes .
you yourself do not happen to notice , madame , when you enter mr.s . Inglethorp 's room , whether that door be bolt or not ?
I.I believe it be .
but you do not see it ?
no .
i.never look .
but I do , interrupted Lawrence suddenly .
I happen to notice that it be bolt .
ah , that settle it .
and Poirot look crestfallen .
I could not help rejoice that , for once , one of he little idea have come to naught .
after lunch Poirot beg I to accompany he home .
I consent rather stiffly .
you be annoyed , be it not so ? he ask anxiously , as we walk through the park .
not at all , I say coldly .
that be well .
that lift a great load from my mind .
this be not quite what I have intend .
I have hope that he would have observe the stiffness of my manner .
still , the fervour of he word go towards the appeasing of my just displeasure .
I thaw .
I give Lawrence you message , I say .
and what do he say ?
he be entirely puzzle ?
yes .
I be quite sure he have no idea of what you mean .
I have expect Poirot to be disappoint ; but , to my surprise , he reply that that be as he have think , and that he be very glad .
my pride forbid I to ask any question .
Poirot switch off on another tack .
Mademoiselle Cynthia be not at lunch today ?
how be that ?
she be at the hospital again .
she resume work today .
ah , she be a industrious little demoiselle .
and pretty too .
she be like picture I have see in Italy .
I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers .
do you think she would show it to I ?
I be sure she would be delighted .
it be a interesting little place .
do she go there every day ?
she have all wednesday off , and come back to lunch on Saturdays .
those be she only time off .
I will remember .
woman be do great work nowadays , and Mademoiselle Cynthia be clever.oh , yes , she have brain , that little one .
yes .
I believe she have pass quite a stiff exam .
without doubt .
after all , it be very responsible work .
I suppose they have very strong poison there ?
yes , she show they to we .
they be keep lock up in a little cupboard .
I believe they have to be very careful .
they always take out the key before leave the room .
indeed .
it be near the window , this cupboard ?
no , right the other side of the room .
why ?
Poirot shrug he shoulder .
I wonder .
that be all .
will you come in ?
we have reach the cottage .
no .
I think I will be get back .
I shall go round the long way through the wood .
the wood round style be very beautiful .
after the walk across the open park , it be pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glade .
there be hardly a breath of wind , the very chirp of the bird be faint and subdue .
I stroll on a little way , and finally fling myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree .
my thought of mankind be kindly and charitable .
I even forgive Poirot for he absurd secrecy .
in fact , I be at peace with the world .
then I yawn .
I think about the crime , and it strike I as be very unreal and far off .
I yawn again .
probably , I think , it really never happen .
of course , it be all a bad dream .
the truth of the matter be that it be Lawrence who have murder Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet .
but it be absurd of John to make such a fuss about it , and to go shout out : I tell you I will not have it !
I wake up with a start .
at once I realize that I be in a very awkward predicament .
for , about twelve foot away from I , John and Mary Cavendish be stand face each other , and they be evidently quarrel .
and , quite as evidently , they be unaware of my vicinity , for before I could move or speak John repeat the word which have arouse I from my dream .
I tell you , Mary , I will not have it .
Mary 's voice come , cool and liquid : have you any right to criticize my action ?
it will be the talk of the village !
my mother be only bury on Saturday , and here you be gad about with the fellow .
oh , she shrug she shoulder , if it be only village gossip that you mind !
but it be not .
I have have enough of the fellow hang about .
he be a polish jew , anyway .
a tinge of jewish blood be not a bad thing .
it leaven the . she look at he . stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman .
fire in she eye , ice in she voice .
I do not wonder that the blood rise to John 's face in a crimson tide .
Mary !
well ?
she tone do not change .
the plead die out of he voice .
be I to understand that you will continue to see bauerstein against my express wish ?
if I choose .
you defy I ?
no , but I deny you right to criticize my action .
have you no friend of whom I should disapprove ?
John fall back a pace.the .
Colour ebb slowly from he face .
what do you mean ? he say , in a unsteady voice .
you see ! say Mary quietly .
you do see , do not you , that you have no right to dictate to I as to the choice of my friend ?
John glance at she pleadingly , a stricken look on he face .
no right ?
have I no right , Mary ? he say unsteadily .
he stretch out he hand .
Mary . .
for a moment , I think she waver .
a softer expression come over she face , then suddenly she turn almost fiercely away .
none !
Mary . he voice be very quiet now . be you in love with this fellow bauerstein ?
she hesitate , and suddenly there sweep across she face a strange expression , old as the hill , yet with something eternally young about it .
so might some egyptian sphinx have smile .
she free herself quietly from he arm , and speak over she shoulder .
perhaps , she say ; and then swiftly pass out of the little glade , leave John stand there as though he have be turn to stone .
rather ostentatiously , I step forward , crackle some dead branch with my foot as I do so .
John turn .
luckily , he take it for grant that I have only just come upon the scene .
Hullo , Hastings .
have you see the little fellow safely back to he cottage ?
quaint little chap !
be he any good , though , really ?
he be consider one of the finest detective of he day .
oh , well , I suppose there must be something in it , then .
what a rotten world it be , though !
you find it so ? I ask .
good lord , yes !
there be this terrible business to start with .
Scotland Yard man in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box !
never know where they will not turn up next .
scream headline in every paper in the country.damn all journalist , I say !
do you know there be a whole crowd stare in at the lodge gate this morning .
sort of Madame Tussaud 's chamber of horror business that can be see for nothing .
Pretty thick , be not it ?
cheer up , John ! I say soothingly .
it can not last for ever .
can not it , though ?
it can last long enough for we never to be able to hold up we head again .
no , no , you be get morbid on the subject .
Enough to make a man morbid , to be stalk by beastly journalist and stare at by gaping moon-faced idiot , wherever he go !
but there be worse than that .
what ?
John lower he voice : have you ever think , hastings.it 's a nightmare to me.who do it ?
I can not help feeling sometimes it must have be a accident .
because.because.who could have do it ?
now Inglethorp 's out of the way , there be no one else ; no one , I mean , except.one of we .
yes , indeed , that be nightmare enough for any man !
one of we ?
yes , surely it must be so , unless . . - a new idea suggest itself to my mind .
rapidly , I consider it .
the light increase .
Poirot 's mysterious doings , he hints.they all fit in .
fool that I be not to have think of this possibility before , and what a relief for we all .
no , John , I say , it be not one of we .
how could it be ?
I know , but , still , who else be there ?
can not you guess ?
no .
I look cautiously round , and lower my voice .
Dr Bauerstein !
I whisper .
impossible !
not at all .
but what earthly interest could he have in my mother 's death ?
that I do not see , I confess , but I will tell you this : Poirot think so .
Poirot ?
do he ?
how do you know ?
I tell he of Poirot 's intense excitement on hearing that Dr Bauerstein have be at style on the fatal night , and add : he say twice : ` that alter everything . ' .
and I have be think .
you know Inglethorp say he have put down the coffee in the hall ?
well , it be just then that bauerstein arrive .
be not it possible that , as Inglethorp bring he through the hall , the doctor drop something into the coffee in pass ?
h be , say John .
it would have be very risky .
yes , but it be possible .
and then , how could he know it be she coffee ?
no , old fellow , I do not think that will wash .
but I have remember something else .
you be quite right .
that be not how it be do .
listen .
and I then tell he of the cocoa sample which Poirot have take to be analyse .
John interrupt just as I have do .
but , look here , bauerstein have have it analyse already ?
yes , yes , that be the point .
I do not see it either until now .
do not you understand ?
bauerstein have it analysed.that 's just it !
if Bauerstein 's the murderer , nothing could be simpler than for he to substitute some ordinary cocoa for he sample , and send that to be test .
and of course they would find no strychnine !
but no one would dream of suspect Bauerstein , or think of take another sample.except Poirot , I add , with belated recognition .
yes , but what about the bitter taste that cocoa will not disguise ?
well , we have only he word for that .
and there be other possibility .
he be admittedly one of the world 's greatest toxicologist . .
one of the world 's greatest what ?
say it again .
he know more about poison than almost anybody , I explain .
well , my idea be , that perhaps he be find some way of make strychnine tasteless .
or it may not have be strychnine at all , but some obscure drug no one have ever hear of , which produce much the same symptom .
h be , yes , that might be , say John .
but look here , how could he have get at the cocoa ?
that be not downstairs ?
no , it be not , I admit reluctantly .
and then , suddenly , a dreadful possibility flash through my mind .
I hope and pray it would not occur to John also .
I glance sideways at he .
he be frown perplexedly , and I draw a deep breath of relief , for the terrible thought that have flash across my mind be this : that Dr Bauerstein might have have a accomplice .
yet surely it could not be !
surely no woman as beautiful as Mary Cavendish could be a murderess .
yet beautiful woman have be know to poison .
and suddenly I remember that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival , and the gleam in she eye as she have say that poison be a woman 's weapon .
how agitate she have be on that fatal Tuesday evening !
have mr.s . Inglethorp discover something between she and bauerstein , and threaten to tell she husband ?
be it to stop that denunciation that the crime have be commit ?
then I remember that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and Evelyn Howard .
be this what they have mean ?
be this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn have try not to believe ?
yes , it all fit in .
no wonder Miss Howard have suggest hush it up .
now I understand that unfinished sentence of hers : Emily herself . .
and in my heart I agree with she .
would not mr.s . Inglethorp have prefer to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of Cavendish .
there be another thing , say John suddenly , and the unexpected sound of he voice make I start guiltily .
something which make I doubt if what you say can be true .
what be that ? I ask , thankful that he have go away from the subject of how the poison could have be introduce into the cocoa .
why , the fact that Bauerstein demand a post-mortem .
he need not have do so .
little wilkin would have be quite content to let it go at heart disease .
yes , I say doubtfully .
but we do not know .
perhaps he think it safer in the long run .
some one might have talk afterwards .
then the Home Office might have order exhumation .
the whole thing would have come out , then , and he would have be in a awkward position , for no one would have believe that a man of he reputation could have be deceive into call it heart disease .
yes , that be possible , admit John .
still , he add , I be blest if I can see what he motive could have be .
I tremble .
look here , I say , I may be altogether wrong .
and , remember , all this be in confidence .
oh , of course.that go without say .
we have walk , as we talk , and now we pass through the little gate into the garden .
voice rise near at hand , for tea be spread out under the sycamore-tree , as it have be on the day of my arrival .
Cynthia be back from the hospital , and I place my chair beside she , and tell she of Poirot 's wish to visit the dispensary .
of course !
I would love he to see it .
he would better come to tea there one day .
I must fix it up with he .
he be such a dear little man !
but he be funny .
he make I take the brooch out of my tie the other day , and put it in again , because he say it be not straight .
I laugh .
it be quite a mania with he .
yes , be not it ?
we be silent for a minute or two , and then , glance in the direction of Mary Cavendish , and drop she voice , Cynthia say : Mr. Hastings .
yes ?
after tea , I want to talk to you .
she glance at Mary have set I think .
I fancy that between these two there exist very little sympathy .
for the first time , it occur to I to wonder about the girl 's future .
mr.s . inglethorp have make no provision of any kind for she , but I imagine that John and Mary would probably insist on she make she home with them.at any rate until the end of the war .
John , I know , be very fond of she , and would be sorry to let she go .
John , who have go into the house , now reappear .
he good-natured face wear a unaccustomed frown of anger .
confound those detective !
I can not think what they be after !
they have be in every room in the house.turning thing inside out , and upside down .
it really be too bad !
I suppose they take advantage of we all be out .
I shall go for that fellow Japp , when I next see he !
lot of Paul Prys , grunt Miss Howard .
Lawrence opine that they have to make a show of do something .
Mary Cavendish say nothing .
after tea , I invite Cynthia to come for a walk , and we saunter off into the wood together .
well ?
I inquire , as soon as we be protect from prying eye by the leafy screen .
with a sigh , Cynthia fling herself down , and toss off she hat .
the sunlight , pierce through the branch , turn the auburn of she hair to quiver gold .
Mr. Hastings.you be always so kind , and you know such a lot .
it strike I at this moment that Cynthia be really a very charming girl !
much more charming than Mary , who never say thing of that kind .
well ? I ask benignantly , as she hesitate .
I want to ask you advice .
what shall I do ?
do ?
yes .
you see , Aunt Emily always tell I I should be provide for .
I suppose she forget , or do not think she be likely to die.anyway , I be not provide for !
and I do not know what to do .
do you think I ought to go away from here at once ?
good heaven , no !
they do not want to part with you , I be sure .
Cynthia hesitate a moment , pluck up the grass with she tiny hand .
then she say : mr.s . Cavendish do .
she hate I .
hate you ? I cry , astonish .
Cynthia nod .
yes .
I do not know why , but she can not bear I ; and he can not , either .
there I know you be wrong , I say warmly .
on the contrary , John be very fond of you .
oh , yes.john .
I mean Lawrence .
not , of course , that I care whether Lawrence hate I or not .
still , it be rather horrid when no one love you , be not it ?
but they do , Cynthia dear , I say earnestly .
I be sure you be mistaken .
look , there be John.and Miss Howard .
Cynthia nod rather gloomily .
yes , John like I , I think , and of course Evie , for all she gruff way , would not be unkind to a fly .
but Lawrence never speak to I if he can help it , and Mary can hardly bring herself to be civil to I .
she want Evie to stay on , be beg she to , but she do not want I , and.and.i do not know what to do .
suddenly the poor child burst out cry .
I do not know what possess I .
she beauty , perhaps , as she sit there , with the sunlight glint down on she head ; perhaps the sense of relief at encounter someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy ; perhaps honest pity for she youth and loneliness .
anyway , I lean forward , and take she little hand , I say awkwardly : marry I , Cynthia .
unwittingly , I have hit upon a sovereign remedy for she tear .
she sit up at once , draw she hand away , and say , with some asperity : do not be silly !
I be a little annoyed .
I be not be silly .
I be ask you to do I the honour of become my wife .
to my intense surprise , Cynthia burst out laughing , and call I a ` funny dear . ' .
it be perfectly sweet of you , she say , but you know you do not want to !
yes , I do .
I have get .
never mind what you have get .
you do not really want to.and I do not either .
well , of course , that settle it , I say stiffly .
but I do not see anything to laugh at .
there be nothing funny about a proposal .
no , indeed , say Cynthia .
somebody might accept you next time .
good-bye , you have cheer I up very much .
and , with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment , she vanish through the tree .
think over the interview , it strike I as be profoundly unsatisfactory .
it occur to I suddenly that I would go down to the village , and look up bauerstein .
somebody ought to be keep a eye on the fellow .
at the same time , it would be wise to allay any suspicion he might have as to he be suspect .
I remember how Poirot have rely on my diplomacy .
accordingly , I go to the little house with the apartment card insert in the window , where I know he lodge , and tap on the door .
a old woman come and open it .
good afternoon , I say pleasantly .
be Dr Bauerstein in ?
she stare at I .
have not you hear ?
hear what ?
about he .
what about he ?
he be take .
Took ?
dead ?
no , take by the perlice .
by the police !
I gasp .
do you mean they have arrest he ?
yes , that be it , and .
I wait to hear no more , but tear up the village to find Poirot .
to my extreme annoyance , Poirot be not in , and the old belgian who answer my knock inform I that he believe he have go to London .
I be dumbfounded .
what on earth could Poirot be do in London !
be it a sudden decision on he part , or have he already make up he mind when he part from I a few hour earlier ?
I retrace my step to style in some annoyance .
with Poirot away , I be uncertain how to act .
have he foresee this arrest ?
have he not , in all probability , be the cause of it ?
those question I could not resolve but in the meantime what be I to do ?
should I announce the arrest openly at style , or not ?
though I do not acknowledge it to myself , the thought of Mary Cavendish be weigh on I .
would it not be a terrible shock to she ?
for the moment , I set aside utterly any suspicion of she .
she could not be implicated.otherwise I should have hear some hint of it .
of course , there be no possibility of be able permanently to conceal Dr Bauerstein 's arrest arrest from she .
it would be announce in every newspaper on the morrow .
still , I shrink from blurt blurt it out .
if only Poirot have be accessible , I could have ask he advice .
what possess possess he to go post off to London in this unaccountable way ?
in spite of myself , my opinion of he sagacity be immeasurably heighten .
I would never have dream of suspect the the doctor , have not Poirot put it into my head .
yes , decidedly , the little man be clever .
after some reflect , I decide to take John into my confidence , and leave he to make the matter public or not , as he think fit .
he give vent to a prodigious whistle , as I impart the news .
great Scot !
you be right , then .
I could not believe it at the time .
no , it be astonishing until you get use to the idea , and see how it make everything fit in .
now , what be we to do ?
of course , it will be generally know tomorrow .
John reflect .
never mind , he say at last , we will not say anything at present .
there be no need .
as you say , it will be know soon enough .
but to my intense surprise , on get down early the next morning , and eagerly open the newspaper , there be not a word about the arrest !
there be a column of mere padding about the Styles Poisoning Case , but nothing further .
it be rather inexplicable , but I suppose that , for some reason or other , Japp wish to keep it out of the papers .
it worry I just a little , for it suggest the possibility that there might be further arrest to come .
after breakfast , I decide to go down to the village , and see if Poirot have return yet ; but , before I could start , a well-known face block one of the window , and the well-known voice say : Bon jour , mon ami !
Poirot , I exclaim , with relief , and seize he by both hand , I drag he into the room .
I be never so glad to see anyone .
listen , I have say nothing to anybody but John .
be that right ?
my friend , reply Poirot , I do not know what you be talk about .
Dr Bauerstein 's arrest , of course , I answer impatiently .
be Bauerstein arrest , then ?
do you not know it ?
not the least in the world .
but , pause a moment , he add : still , it do not surprise I .
after all , we be only four mile from the coast .
the coast ? I ask , puzzle .
what have that get to do with it ?
Poirot shrug he shoulder .
surely , it be obvious !
not to I .
no doubt I be very dense , but I can not see what the proximity of the coast have get to do with the murder of mr.s . inglethorp .
nothing at all , of course , reply Poirot , smile .
but we be speak of the arrest of Dr Bauerstein .
well , he be arrest for the murder of mr.s . inglethorp . .
what ? cry Poirot , in apparently lively astonishment .
dr bauerstein arrest for the murder of mr.s . Inglethorp ?
yes .
impossible !
that would be too good a farce !
who tell you that , my friend ?
well , no one exactly tell I , I confess .
but he be arrest .
oh , yes , very likely .
but for espionage , mon ami .
espionage ?
I gasp .
precisely .
not for poisoning mr.s . Inglethorp ?
not unless we friend Japp have take leave of he sens , reply Poirot placidly .
but.but I think you think so too ?
Poirot give I one look , which convey a wonder pity , and he full sense of the utter absurdity of such a idea .
do you mean to say , I ask , slowly adapt myself to the new idea , that dr bauerstein be a spy ?
Poirot nod .
have you never suspect it ?
it never enter my head .
it do not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this , and should be in the habit of walk about at all hour of the night , fully dress ?
no , I confess , I never think of such a thing .
he be , of course , a german by birth , say Poirot thoughtfully , though he have practice so long in this country that nobody think of he as anything but a Englishman .
he be naturalized about fifteen year ago .
a very clever man.a jew , of course .
the blackguard ! I cry indignantly .
not at all .
he be , on the contrary , a patriot .
think what he stand to lose .
I admire the man myself .
but I could not look at it in Poirot 's philosophical way .
and this be the man with whom Mr.s . Cavendish have be wander about all over the country ! I cry indignantly .
yes .
I should fancy he have find she very useful , remark Poirot .
so long as gossip busy itself in coupling they name together , any other vagary of the doctor 's pass unobserved .
then you think he never really care for she ? I ask eagerly.rather too eagerly , perhaps , under the circumstance .
that , of course , I can not say , but.shall I tell you my own private opinion , Hastings ?
yes .
well , it be this : that mr.s . Cavendish do not care , and never have care one little jot about Dr Bauerstein !
do you really think so ?
I could not disguise my pleasure .
I be quite sure of it .
and I will tell you why .
yes ?
because she care for some one else , mon ami .
oh !
what do he mean ?
in spite of myself , a agreeable warmth spread over I .
I be not a vain man where woman be concern , but I remember certain evidence , too lightly think of at the time , perhaps , but which certainly seem to indicate . .
my pleasing thought be interrupt by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard .
she glance round hastily to make sure there be no one else in the room , and quickly produce a old sheet of brown paper .
this she hand to Poirot , murmur as she do so the cryptic word : on top of the wardrobe .
then she hurriedly leave the room .
Poirot unfold the sheet of paper eagerly , and utter a exclamation of satisfaction .
he spread it out on the table .
come here , Hastings .
now tell I , what be that initial.j .
or L. ?
it be a medium size sheet of paper , rather dusty , as though it have lie by for some time .
but it be the label that be attract Poirot 's attention .
at the top , it bear the print stamp of Messrs.
Parkson 's , the well-known theatrical costumier , and it be address to . -lrb- the debatable initial -rrb- Cavendish , Esq. , .
Styles Court , Styles St.
Mary , Essex .
it might be T. , .
or it might be L. , .
I say , after study the thing for a minute or two .
it certainly be not a J.
good , reply Poirot , folding up the paper again .
I , also , be of you way of thinking .
it be a l. , .
depend upon it !
where do it come from ? I ask curiously .
be it important ?
moderately so .
it confirm a surmise of mine .
have deduce its existence , I set Miss Howard to search for it , and , as you see , she have be successful .
what do she mean by ` on the top of the wardrobe ' ?
she mean , reply Poirot promptly , that she find it on top of a wardrobe .
a funny place for a piece of brown paper , I muse .
not at all .
the top of a wardrobe be a excellent place for brown paper and cardboard box .
I have keep they there myself .
neatly arrange , there be nothing to offend the eye .
Poirot , I ask earnestly , have you make up you mind about this crime ?
yes.that be to say , I believe I know how it be commit .
ah !
unfortunately , I have no proof beyond my surmise , unless . .
with sudden energy , he catch I by the arm , and whirl I down the hall , call out in french in he excitement : Mademoiselle Dorcas , Mademoiselle Dorcas , un moment , be ` il vous plait !
Dorcas , quite flurry by the noise , come hurry out of the pantry .
my good Dorcas , I have a idea.a little idea.if it should prove justified , what magnificent chance !
tell I , on Monday , not Tuesday , Dorcas , but Monday , the day before the tragedy , do anything go wrong with mr.s . Inglethorp 's bell ?
Dorcas look very surprised .
yes , sir , now you mention it , it do ; though I do not know how you come to hear of it .
a mouse , or some such , must have nibble the wire through .
the man come and put it right on Tuesday morning .
with a long draw exclamation of ecstasy , Poirot lead the way back to the morning-room .
see you , one should not ask for outside proof.no , reason should be enough .
but the flesh be weak , it be consolation to find that one be on the right track .
ah , my friend , I be like a giant refresh .
I run !
I leap !
and , in very truth , run and leap he do , gambol wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window .
what be you remarkable little friend do ? ask a voice behind I , and I turn to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow .
she smile , and so do I .
what be it all about ?
really , I can not tell you .
he ask Dorcas some question about a bell , and appear so delighted with she answer that he be caper about as you see !
Mary laugh .
how ridiculous !
he be go out of the gate .
be not he come back today ?
I do not know .
I have give up try to guess what he will do next .
be he quite mad , Mr. Hastings ?
I honestly do not know .
sometimes , I feel sure he be as mad as a hatter ; and then , just as he be at he maddest , I find there be method in he madness .
I see .
in spite of she laugh , Mary be look thoughtful this morning .
she seem grave , almost sad .
it occur to I that it would be a good opportunity to tackle she on the subject of Cynthia .
I begin rather tactfully , I think , but I have not go far before she stop I authoritatively .
you be a excellent advocate , I have no doubt , Mr. Hastings , but in this case you talent be quite throw away .
Cynthia will run no risk of encounter any unkindness from I .
I begin to stammer feebly that I hope she have not thought.but again she stop I , and she word be so unexpected that they quite drive Cynthia , and she trouble , out of my mind .
Mr. Hastings , she say , do you think I and my husband be happy together ?
I be considerably take aback , and murmur something about it be not be my business to think anything of the sort .
well , she say quietly , whether it be you business or not , I will tell you that we be not happy .
I say nothing , for I see that she have not finish .
she begin slowly , walk up and down the room , she head a little bent , and that slim , supple figure of hers sway gently as she walk .
she stop suddenly , and look up at I .
you do not know anything about I , do you ? she ask .
where I come from , who I be before I marry john.anything , in fact ?
well , I will tell you .
I will make a father confessor of you .
you be kind , I think.yes , I be sure you be kind .
somehow , I be not quite as elated as I might have be .
I remember that Cynthia have begin she confidence in much the same way .
besides , a father confessor should be elderly , it be not at all the role for a young man .
my father be English , say mr.s . Cavendish , but my mother be a russian .
ah , I say , now I understand .
understand what ?
a hint of something foreign.different.that there have always be about you .
my mother be very beautiful , I believe .
I do not know , because I never see she .
she die when I be quite a little child .
I believe there be some tragedy connect with she death.she take a overdose of some sleep draught by mistake .
however that may be , my father be broken-hearted .
shortly afterwards , he go into the Consular Service .
everywhere he go , I go with he .
when I be twenty-three , I have be nearly all over the world .
it be a splendid life.i love it .
there be a smile on she face , and she head be throw back .
she seem live in the memory of those old glad day .
then my father die .
he leave I very badly off .
I have to go and live with some old aunt in Yorkshire .
she shudder .
you will understand I when I say that it be a deadly life for a girl bring up as I have be .
the narrowness , the deadly monotony of it , almost drive I mad .
she pause a minute , and add in a different tone : and then I meet John Cavendish .
yes ?
you can imagine that , from my aunt ' point of view , it be a very good match for I .
but I can honestly say it be not this fact which weigh with I .
no , he be simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life .
I say nothing , and after a moment , she go on : do not misunderstand I .
I be quite honest with he .
I tell he , what be true , that I like he very much , that I hope to come to like he more , but that I be not in any way what the world call ` in love ' with he .
he declare that that satisfied he , and so.we be marry .
she wait a long time , a little frown have gather on she forehead .
she seem to be look back earnestly into those past day .
I think.i am sure.he care for I at first .
but I suppose we be not well match .
almost at once , we drift apart .
he.it be not a please thing for my pride , but it be the truth.tired of I very soon .
I must have make some murmur of dissent , for she go on quickly : oh , yes , he do !
not that it matter now.now that we have come to the parting of the way .
what do you mean ?
she answer quietly : I mean that I be not go to remain at style .
you and John be not go to live here ?
John may live here , but I shall not .
you be go to leave he ?
yes .
but why ?
she pause a long time , and say at last : perhaps.because I want to be.free !
and , as she speak , I have a sudden vision of broad space , virgin tract of forest , untrodden lands.and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish .
I seem to see she for a moment as she be , a proud wild creature , as untame by civilization as some shy bird of the hill .
a little cry break from she lip : you do not know , you do not know , how this hateful place have be prison to I !
I understand , I say , but.but do not do anything rash .
oh , rash !
she voice mock at my prudence .
then suddenly I say a thing I could have bite out my tongue for : you know that dr bauerstein have be arrest ?
a instant coldness pass like a mask over she face , blot out all expression .
John be so kind as to break that to I this morning .
well , what do you think ? I ask feebly .
of what ?
of the arrest ?
what should I think ?
apparently he be a german spy ; so the gardener have tell John .
she face and voice be absolutely cold and expressionless .
do she care , or do she not ?
she move away a step or two , and finger one of the flower vase .
these be quite dead .
I must do they again .
would you mind moving.thank you , Mr. Hastings .
and she walk quietly past I out of the window , with a cool little nod of dismissal .
no , surely she could not care for bauerstein .
no woman could act she part with that icy unconcern .
Poirot do not make he appearance the follow morning , and there be no sign of the Scotland Yard man .
but , at lunch-time , there arrive a new piece of evidence.or rather lack of evidence .
we have vainly try to trace the fourth letter , which Mr.s . Inglethorp have write on the evening precede she death .
we effort have be in vain , we have abandon the matter , hope that it might turn up of itself one day .
and this be just what do happen , in the shape of a communication , which arrive by the second post from a firm of french music publisher , acknowledge mr.s . Inglethorp 's cheque , and regret they have be unable to trace a certain series of russian folksong .
so the last hope of solve the mystery , by means of mr.s . Inglethorp 's correspondence on the fatal evening , have to be abandon .
just before tea , I stroll down to tell Poirot of the new disappointment , but find , to my annoyance , that he be once more out .
go to London again ?
oh , no , monsieur , he have but take the train to Tadminster .
` to see a young lady 's dispensary , ' he say .
silly ass !
I ejaculate .
I tell he Wednesday be the one day she be not there !
well , tell he to look we up tomorrow morning , will you ?
certainly , monsieur .
but , on the follow day , no sign of Poirot .
I be get angry .
he be really treat we in the most cavalier fashion .
after lunch , Lawrence draw I aside , and ask if I be go down to see he .
no , I do not think I shall .
he can come up here if he want to see we .
oh !
Lawrence look indeterminate .
something unusually nervous and excite in he manner rouse my curiosity .
what be it ? I ask .
I could go if there be anything special .
it be nothing much , but.well , if you be go , will you tell he . he drop he voice to a whisper . I think I have find the extra coffee-cup !
I have almost forget that enigmatical message of Poirot 's , but now my curiosity be arouse afresh .
Lawrence would say no more , so I decide that I would descend from my high horse , and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage .
this time I be receive with a smile .
Monsieur Poirot be within .
would I mount ?
I mount accordingly .
Poirot be sit by the table , he head bury in he hand .
he spring up at my entrance .
what be it ? I ask solicitously .
you be not ill , I trust ?
no , no , not ill .
but I decide a affair of great moment .
whether to catch the criminal or not ? I ask facetiously .
but , to my great surprise , Poirot nod gravely .
` to speak or not to speak , ' as you so great Shakespeare say , ` that be the question . ' .
I do not trouble to correct the quotation .
you be not serious , Poirot ?
I be of the most serious .
for the most serious of all thing hang in the balance .
and that be ?
a woman 's happiness , mon ami , he say gravely .
I do not quite know what to say .
the moment have come , say Poirot thoughtfully , and I do not know what to do .
for , see you , it be a big stake for which I play .
no one but I , Hercule Poirot , would attempt it !
and he tap himself proudly on the breast .
after pause a few minute respectfully , so as not to spoil he effect , I give he Lawrence 's message .
aha ! he cry .
so he have find the extra coffee-cup .
that be good .
he have more intelligence than would appear , this long-faced Monsieur Lawrence of yours !
I do not myself think very highly of Lawrence 's intelligence ; but I forebore to contradict Poirot , and gently take he to task for forget my instruction as to which be Cynthia 's day off .
it be true .
I have the head of a sieve .
however , the other young lady be most kind .
she be sorry for my disappointment , and show I everything in the kindest way .
oh , well , that be all right , then , and you must go to tea with Cynthia another day .
I tell he about the letter .
I be sorry for that , he say .
I always have hope of that letter .
but no , it be not to be .
this affair must all be unravel from within .
he tap he forehead .
these little grey cell .
it be ` up to they ' . as you say over here .
then , suddenly , he ask : be you a judge of finger-mark , my friend ?
no , I say , rather surprised , I know that there be no two finger-mark alike , but that be as far as my science go .
exactly .
he unlock a little drawer , and take out some photograph which he lay on the table .
I have number they , 1 2 3 .
will you describe they to I ?
I study the proof attentively .
all greatly magnify , I see .
no.
1 I should say , be a man 's finger-print ; thumb and first finger .
no.
2 be a lady 's ; they be much smaller , and quite different in every way .
3 . I pause for some time . there seem to be a lot of confused finger-mark , but here , very distinctly , be no.
1 's .
overlap the other ?
yes .
you recognize they beyond fail ?
oh , yes ; they be identical .
Poirot nod , and gently take the photograph from I lock they up again .
I suppose , I say , that as usual , you be not go to explain ?
on the contrary .
no.
1 be the finger-print of Monsieur Lawrence .
no.
2 be those of Mademoiselle Cynthia .
they be not important .
I merely obtain they for comparison .
no.
3 be a little more complicated .
yes ?
it be , as you see , highly magnify .
you may have notice a sort of blur extend all across the picture .
I will not describe to you the special apparatus , dust powder , etc. , .
which I use .
it be a well-known process to the police , and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger-print of any object in a very short space of time .
well , my friend , you have see the finger-mark . it remain to tell you the particular object on which they have be leave .
go on.i be really excite .
eh bien !
Photo no.
3 represent the highly magnify surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster.which sound like the house that Jack build !
good heaven !
I exclaim .
but what be Lawrence Cavendish 's finger-mark do on it ?
he never go near the poison cupboard the day we be there !
oh , yes , he do !
impossible !
we be all together the whole time .
Poirot shake he head .
no , my friend , there be a moment when you be not all together .
there be a moment when you could not have be all together , or it would not have be necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony .
I would forget that , I admit .
but it be only for a moment .
Long enough .
Long enough for what ?
Poirot 's smile become rather enigmatical .
Long enough for a gentleman who have once study medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity .
we eye meet .
Poirot 's be pleasantly vague .
he get up and hum a little tune .
I watch he suspiciously .
Poirot , I say , what be in this particular little bottle ?
Poirot look out of the window .
hydro-chloride of strychnine , he say , over he shoulder , continue to hum .
good heaven !
I say it quite quietly .
I be not surprise .
I have expect that answer .
they use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little.only occasionally for pill .
it be the official solution , Liq .
Strychnine hydro-clor .
that be use in most medicine .
that be why the finger-mark have remain undisturbed since then .
how do you manage to take this photograph ?
I drop my hat from the balcony , explain Poirot simply .
visitor be not permit below at that hour , so , in spite of my many apology , Mademoiselle Cynthia 's colleague have to go down and fetch it for I .
then you know what you be go to find ?
no , not at all .
I merely realize that it be possible , from you story , for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard .
the possibility have to be confirm , or eliminate .
Poirot , I say , you gaiety do not deceive I .
this be a very important discovery .
I do not know , say Poirot .
but one thing do strike I .
no doubt it have strike you too .
what be that ?
why , that there be altogether too much strychnine about this case .
this be the third time we run up against it .
there be strychnine in mr.s . Inglethorp 's tonic .
there be the strychnine sell across the counter at Styles St.
Mary by Mace .
now we have more strychnine , handle by one of the household .
it be confuse ; and , as you know , I do not like confusion .
before I could reply , one of the other Belgians open the door and stick he head in .
there be a lady below , ask for Mr. Hastings .
a lady ?
I jump up .
Poirot follow I down the narrow stair .
Mary Cavendish be stand in the doorway .
I have be visit a old woman in the village , she explain , and as Lawrence tell I you be with Monsieur Poirot I think I would call for you .
alas , madame , say Poirot , I think you have come to honour I with a visit !
I will some day , if you ask I , she promise he , smile .
that be well .
if you should need a father confessor , madame . she start ever so slightly . remember , papa Poirot be always at you service .
she stare at he for a few minute , as though seek to read some deeper meaning into he word .
then she turn abruptly away .
come , will you not walk back with we too , Monsieur Poirot ?
enchanted , madame .
all the way to style , Mary talk fast and feverishly .
it strike I that in some way she be nervous of Poirot 's eye .
the weather have break , and the sharp wind be almost autumnal in its shrewishness .
Mary shiver a little , and button she black sport coat closer .
the wind through the tree make a mournful noise , like some great giant sighing .
we walk up to the great door of style , and at once the knowledge come to we that something be wrong .
Dorcas come run out to meet we .
she be cry and wring she hand .
I be aware of other servant huddle together in the background , all eye and ear .
oh , m ` be !
oh , m ` be !
I do not know how to tell you .
what be it , Dorcas ? I ask impatiently .
tell we at once .
it be those wicked detective .
they have arrest him.they have arrest Mr. Cavendish !
arrest Lawrence ?
I gasp .
I see a strange look come into Dorcas 's eye .
no , sir .
not Mr. Lawrence.Mr . John .
behind I , with a wild cry , Mary Cavendish fall heavily against I , and as I turn to catch she I meet the quiet triumph in Poirot 's eye .
the trial of John Cavendish for the murder of he stepmother take place two month later .
of the intervene week I will say little , but my admiration and sympathy go out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish .
she range herself passionately on she husband 's side , scorn the mere idea of he guilt , and fight for he tooth and nail .
I express my admiration to Poirot , and he nod thoughtfully .
yes , she be of those woman who show at they best in adversity .
it bring out all that be sweetest and truest in they .
she pride and she jealousy have .
jealousy ? I query .
yes .
have you not realize that she be a unusually jealous woman ?
as I be say , she pride and jealousy have be lay aside .
she think of nothing but she husband , and the terrible fate that be hang over he .
he speak very feelingly , and I look at he earnestly , remember that last afternoon , when he have be deliberate whether or not to speak .
with he tenderness for ` a woman 's happiness ' , I feel glad that the decision have be take out of he hand .
even now , I say , I can hardly believe it .
you see , up to the very last minute , I think it be Lawrence !
Poirot grin .
I know you do .
but John !
my old friend John !
every murderer be probably somebody 's old friend , observe Poirot philosophically .
you can not mix up sentiment and reason .
I must say I think you might have give I a hint .
perhaps , mon ami , I do not do so , just because he be you old friend .
I be rather disconcert by this , remember how I have busily pass on to John what I believe to be Poirot 's view concern bauerstein .
he , by the way , have be acquit of the charge bring against he .
nevertheless , although he have be too clever for they this time , and the charge of espionage could not be bring home to he , he wing be pretty well clip for the future .
I ask Poirot whether he think John would be condemn .
to my intense surprise , he reply that , on the contrary , he be extremely likely to be acquit .
but , Poirot . I protest .
oh , my friend , have I not say to you all along that I have no proof .
it be one thing to know that a man be guilty , it be quite another matter to prove he so .
and , in this case , there be terribly little evidence .
that be the whole trouble .
I , Hercule Poirot , know , but I lack the last link in my chain .
and unless I can find that miss link . he shake he head gravely .
when do you first suspect John Cavendish ? I ask , after a minute or two .
do you not suspect he at all ?
no , indeed .
not after that fragment of conversation you overhear between mr.s . Cavendish and she mother-in-law , and she subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest ?
no .
do you not put two and two together , and reflect that if it be not Alfred Inglethorp who be quarrel with he wife.and you remember , he strenuously deny it at the inquest.it must be either Lawrence or John .
now , if it be Lawrence , Mary Cavendish 's conduct be just as inexplicable .
but if , on the other hand , it be John , the whole thing be explain quite naturally .
so , I cry , a light breaking in upon I , it be John who quarrel with he mother that afternoon ?
exactly .
and you have know this all along ?
certainly .
mr.s . Cavendish 's behaviour could only be explain that way .
and yet you say he may be acquit ?
Poirot shrug he shoulder .
certainly I do .
at the police court proceedings , we shall hear the case for the prosecution , but in all probability he solicitor will advise he to reserve he defence .
that will be spring upon we at the trial .
And.ah , by the way , I have a word of caution to give you , my friend .
I must not appear in the case .
what ?
no .
officially , I have nothing to do with it .
until I have find that last link in my chain , I must remain behind the scene .
mr.s . Cavendish must think I be work for she husband , not against he .
I say , that be play it a bit low down , I protest .
not at all .
we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man , and we must use any means in we power.otherwise he will slip through we finger .
that be why I have be careful to remain in the background .
all the discovery have be make by Japp , and Japp will take all the credit .
if I be call upon to give evidence at all . he smile broadly . it will probably be as a witness for the defence .
I could hardly believe my ear .
it be quite en regle , continue Poirot .
strangely enough , I can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution .
which one ?
the one that relate to the destruction of the will .
John Cavendish do not destroy that will .
Poirot be a true prophet .
I will not go into the detail of the police court proceedings , as it involve many tiresome repetition .
I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserve he defence , and be duly commit for trial .
September find we all in London .
Mary take a house in Kensington , Poirot be include in the family party .
I myself have be give a job at the War Office , so be able to see they continually .
as the week go by , the state of Poirot 's nerve grow worse and worse .
that ` last link ' he talk about be still lack .
privately , I hope it might remain so , for what happiness could there be for Mary , if John be not acquit ?
on September 15th John Cavendish appear in the dock at the Old Bailey , charge with the wilful murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp , and plead not Guilty .
Sir Ernest Heavywether , the famous K.
C. , .
have be engage to defend he .
Mr. Philips , K.
C. , .
open the case for the Crown .
the murder , he say , be a most premeditated and cold-blooded one .
it be neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she have be more than a mother .
ever since he boyhood , she have support he .
he and he wife have live at Styles Court in every luxury , surround by she care and attention .
she have be they kind and generous benefactress .
he propose to call witness to show how the prisoner , a profligate and spendthrift , have be at the end of he financial tether , and have also be carry on a intrigue with a certain mr.s . Raikes , a neighbouring farmer 's wife .
this have come to he stepmother 's ear , she tax he with it on the afternoon before she death , and a quarrel ensue , part of which be overhear .
on the previous day , the prisoner have purchase strychnine at the village chemist 's shop , wear a disguise by means of which he hope to throw the onus of the crime upon another man.to wit , mr.s . Inglethorp 's husband , of whom he have be bitterly jealous .
luckily for Mr. Inglethorp , he have be able to produce a unimpeachable alibi .
on the afternoon of July 17th , continue Counsel , immediately after the quarrel with she son , mr.s . inglethorp make a new will .
this will be find destroy in the grate of she bedroom the follow morning , but evidence have come to light which show that it have be draw up in favour of she husband .
deceased have already make a will in he favour before she marriage , but.and Mr. Philips wag a expressive forefinger.the prisoner be not aware of that .
what have induce the decease to make a fresh will , with the old one still extant , he could not say .
she be a old lady , and might possibly have forget the former one ; or.this seem to he more likely.she may have have a idea that it be revoke by she marriage , as there have be some conversation on the subject .
Ladies be not always very well verse in legal knowledge .
she have , about a year before , execute a will in favour of the prisoner .
he would call evidence to show that it be the prisoner who ultimately hand he stepmother she coffee on the fatal night .
later in the evening , he have seek admission to she room , on which occasion , no doubt , he find a opportunity of destroy the will which , as far as he know , would render the one in he favour valid .
the prisoner have be arrest in consequence of the discovery , in he room , by Detective Inspector Japp.a most brilliant officer.of the identical phial of strychnine which have be sell at the village chemist 's to the suppose Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder .
it would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning fact constitute a overwhelming proof of the prisoner 's guilt .
and , subtly imply that a jury which do not so decide , be quite unthinkable , Mr. Philips sit down and wipe he forehead .
the first witness for the prosecution be mostly those who have be call at the inquest , the medical evidence be again take first .
Sir Ernest Heavywether , who be famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bully witness , only ask two question .
I take it , Dr Bauerstein , that strychnine , as a drug , act quickly ?
yes .
and that you be unable to account for the delay in this case ?
yes .
thank you .
Mr. Mace identify the phial handed he by Counsel as that sell by he to Mr. Inglethorp .
press , he admit that he only know Mr. Inglethorp by sight .
he have never speak to he .
the witness be not cross-examine .
Alfred Inglethorp be call , and deny have purchase the poison .
he also deny have quarrel with he wife .
various witness testify to the accuracy of these statement .
the gardener ' evidence , as to the witness of the will be take , and then Dorcas be call .
Dorcas , faithful to she young gentleman , deny strenuously that it could have be John 's voice she hear , and resolutely declare , in the tooth of everything , that it be Mr. Inglethorp who have be in the boudoir with she mistress .
a rather wistful smile pass across the face of the prisoner in the dock .
he know only too well how useless she gallant defiance be , since it be not the object of the defence to deny this point .
mr.s . Cavendish , of course , could not be call upon to give evidence against she husband .
after various question on other matter , Mr. Philips ask : in the month of June last , do you remember a parcel arrive for Mr. Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson 's ?
Dorcas shake she head .
I do not remember , sir .
it may have do , but Mr. Lawrence be away from home part of June .
in the event of a parcel arrive for he whilst he be away , what would be do with it ?
it would either be put in he room or send on after he .
by you ?
no , sir , I should leave it on the hall table .
it would be Miss Howard who would attend to anything like that .
Evelyn Howard be call and , after be examine on other point , be question as to the parcel .
do not remember .
lot of parcel come .
can not remember one special one .
you do not know if it be send after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales , or whether it be put in he room ?
do not think it be send after he .
should have remember it if it be .
suppose a parcel arrive address to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish , and afterwards it disappear , should you remark its absence ?
no , do not think so .
I should think some one have take charge of it .
I believe , Miss Howard , that it be you who find this sheet of brown paper ?
he hold up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I have examine in the morning-room at style .
yes , I do .
how do you come to look for it ?
the belgian detective who be employ on the case ask I to search for it .
where do you eventually discover it ?
on the top of.of.a wardrobe .
on top of the prisoner 's wardrobe ?
I.I believe so .
do you not find it yourself ?
yes .
then you must know where you find it ?
yes , it be on the prisoner 's wardrobe .
that be better .
a assistant from Parkson 's , theatrical costumier , testify that on June 29th , they have supply a black beard to Mr. L.
Cavendish , as request .
it be order by letter , and a postal order be enclose .
no , they have not keep the letter .
all transaction be enter in they book .
they have send the beard , as direct , to ` l.
Cavendish , Esq. , .
Styles Court . ' .
Sir Ernest Heavywether rise ponderously .
where be the letter write from ?
from Styles Court .
the same address to which you send the parcel ?
yes .
and the letter come from there ?
yes .
like a beast of prey , Heavywether fall upon he : how do you know ?
I.I do not understand .
how do you know that letter come from style ?
do you notice the postmark ?
no.but . ah , you do not notice the postmark !
and yet you affirm so confidently that it come from style .
it might , in fact , have be any postmark ?
y.es .
in fact , the letter , though write on stamped notepaper , might have be post from anywhere ?
from Wales , for instance ?
the witness admit that such might be the case , and Sir Ernest signify that he be satisfy .
Elizabeth Wells , second housemaid at Styles , state that after she have go to bed she remember that she have bolt the front door , instead of leave it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp have request .
she have accordingly go downstairs again to rectify she error .
hear a slight noise in the West wing , she have peep along the passage , and have see Mr. John Cavendish knock at Mr.s . Inglethorp 's door .
Sir Ernest Heavywether make short work of she , and under he unmerciful bullying she contradict herself hopelessly , and Sir Ernest sit down again with a satisfied smile on he face .
with the evidence of Annie , as to the candle grease on the floor , and as to see the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir , the proceedings be adjourn until the follow day .
as we go home , Mary Cavendish speak bitterly against the prosecute counsel .
that hateful man !
what a net he have draw around my poor John !
how he twist every little fact until he make it seem what it be not !
well , I say consolingly , it will be the other way about tomorrow .
yes , she say meditatively ; then suddenly drop she voice .
Mr. Hastings , you do not think.surely think.surely it could not have be Lawrence.Oh , no , that could not be !
but I myself be puzzle , and as soon as I be alone with poirot I ask he what he think Sir Ernest be drive at .
ah ! say Poirot appreciatively .
he be a clever man , that Sir Ernest .
do you think he believe Lawrence guilty ?
I do not think he believe or care anything !
no , what he be try for be to create such confusion in the mind of the jury that they be divide in they opinion as to which brother do it .
he be endeavour to make out that there be quite as much evidence against Lawrence as against John.and I be not at all sure that he will not succeed .
detective-inspector detective-inspector japp be the first witness call when the trial be reopen , and give he evidence succinctly and briefly .
after relate the earlier event , he proceed : acting on information receive , Superintendent Summerhaye and myself search the prisoner 's room , during he temporary absence from the house .
in he chest of drawer , hide beneath some underclothing , we find : first , a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those wear by Mr. Inglethorp , these be exhibit , secondly , this phial .
the phial be that already recognize by the chemist 's assistant , a tiny bottle of blue glass , contain a few grain of a white crystalline powder , and label : Strychnine Hydrochloride .
poison .
a fresh piece of evidence discover by the detective since the police court proceedings be a long , almost new piece of blotting-paper .
it have be find in mr.s . Inglethorp 's cheque book , and on be reverse at a mirror , show clearly the word : .
.
.
erything of which I die possess I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing .
this place beyond question the fact that the destroy will have be in favour of the deceased lady 's husband .
Japp then produce the char fragment of paper recover from the grate , and this , with the discovery of the beard in the attic , complete he evidence .
but Sir Ernest 's cross-examination be yet to come .
what day be it when you search the prisoner 's room ?
Tuesday , the 24th of July .
exactly a week after the tragedy ?
yes .
you find these two object , you say , in the chest of drawer .
be the drawer unlock ?
yes .
do it not strike you as unlikely that a man who have commit a crime should keep the evidence of it in a unlock drawer for anyone to find ?
he might have stow they there in a hurry .
but you have just say it be a whole week since the crime .
he would have have ample time to remove they and destroy they .
perhaps .
there be no perhaps about it .
would he , or would he not have have plenty of time to remove and destroy they ?
yes .
be the pile of underclothes under which the thing be hide heavy or light ?
heavyish .
in other word , it be winter underclothing .
obviously , the prisoner would not be likely to go to that drawer ?
perhaps not .
kindly answer my question .
would the prisoner , in the hottest week of a hot summer , be likely to go to a drawer contain winter underclothing .
yes , or no ?
no .
in that case , be it not possible that the article in question might have be put there by a third person , and that the prisoner be quite unaware of they presence ?
I should not think it likely .
but it be possible ?
yes .
that be all .
more evidence follow .
evidence as to the financial difficulty in which the prisoner have find himself at the end of July .
evidence as to he intrigue with mr.s . raikes.poor Mary , that must have be bitter hearing for a woman of she pride .
Evelyn Howard have be right in she fact , though she animosity against Alfred Inglethorp have cause she to jump to the conclusion that he be the person concern .
Lawrence Cavendish be then put into the box .
in a low voice , in answer to Mr. Philips ' question , he deny have order anything from Parkson 's in June .
in fact , on June 29th , he have be stay away , in Wales .
instantly , Sir Ernest 's chin be shooting pugnaciously forward .
you deny have order a black beard from Parkson 's on June 29th ?
I do .
ah !
in the event of anything happen to you brother , who will inherit Styles Court ?
the brutality of the question call a flush to Lawrence 's pale face .
the judge give vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation , and the prisoner in the dock lean forward angrily .
Heavywether care nothing for he client 's anger .
answer my question , if you please .
I suppose , say Lawrence quietly , that I should .
what do you mean by you ` suppose ' ?
you brother have no child .
you would inherit it , would not you ?
yes .
ah , that be better , say Heavywether , with ferocious geniality .
and you would inherit a good slice of money too , would not you ?
really , Sir Ernest , protest the judge , these question be not relevant .
Sir Ernest bow , and have shoot he arrow proceed .
on Tuesday , the 17th July , you go , I believe , with another guest , to visit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster ?
yes .
do you , while you happen to be alone for a few seconds , unlock the poison cupboard , and examine some of the bottle ?
I.I.may have do so .
I put it to you that you do do so ?
yes .
Sir Ernest fairly shoot the next question at he .
do you examine one bottle in particular ?
no , I do not think so .
be careful , Mr. Cavendish .
I be refer to a little bottle of hydro-chloride hydro-chloride of Strychnine .
Lawrence be turn a sickly greenish colour .
n.o.i n.o.i be sure I do not .
then how do you account for the fact that you leave the unmistakable impress of you finger-print on it ?
the bully manner be highly efficacious with a nervous disposition .
I.I suppose I must have take up the bottle .
I suppose so too !
do you abstract any of the contents of the bottle ?
certainly not .
then why do you take it up ?
I once study to be a doctor .
such thing naturally interest I .
ah !
so poison ` naturally interest ' you , do they ?
still , you wait to be alone before gratify that ` interest ' of yours ?
that be pure chance .
if the other have be there , I should have do just the same .
still , as it happen , the other be not there ?
no , but . .
in fact , during the whole afternoon , you be only alone for a couple of minute , and it happened.i say , it happened.to be during those two minute that you display you ` natural interest ' in hydro-chloride of Strychnine ?
Lawrence stammer pitiably .
I.I. .
with a satisfied and expressive countenance , Sir Ernest observe : I have nothing more to ask you , Mr. Cavendish .
this bit of cross-examination cross-examination have cause great excitement in court .
the head of the many fashionably attired woman present be busily lay together , and they whisper become so loud that the judge angrily threaten to have the court clear if there be not immediate silence .
there be little more evidence .
the hand-writing expert be call upon for they opinion of the signature of ` Alfred Inglethorp ' in the chemist 's poison register .
they all declare unanimously that it be certainly not he hand-writing , and give it as they view that it might be that of the prisoner disguise .
cross-examine , they admit that it might be the prisoner 's hand-writing cleverly counterfeit .
Sir Ernest Heavywether 's speech in open the case for the defence be not a long one , but it be back by the full force of he emphatic manner .
never , he say , in the course of he long experience , have he know a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence .
not only be it entirely circumstantial , but the greater part of it be practically unproved .
let they take the testimony they have hear and sift it impartially .
the strychnine have be find in a drawer in the prisoner 's room .
that drawer be a unlock one , as he have point out , and he submit that there be no evidence to prove that it be the prisoner who have conceal the poison there .
it be , in fact , a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner .
the prosecution have be unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of they contention that it be the prisoner who order the black beard from Parkson 's .
the quarrel which have take place between prisoner and he stepmother be freely admit , but both it and he financial embarrassment have be grossly exaggerated .
he learn friend , Sir Ernest nod carelessly at Mr. Philips , have state that if the prisoner be a innocent man , he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it be he , and not Mr. Inglethorp , who have be the participator in the quarrel .
he think the fact have be misrepresent .
what have actually occur be this .
the prisoner , return to the house on Tuesday evening , have be authoritatively tell that there have be a violent quarrel between Mr. and Mr.s . Inglethorp .
no suspicion have enter the prisoner 's head that anyone could possibly have mistake he voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp .
he naturally conclude that he stepmother have have two quarrel .
the prosecution aver that on Monday , July 16th , the prisoner have enter the chemist 's shop in the village , disguise as Mr. Inglethorp .
the prisoner , on the contrary , be at that time at a lonely spot call Marston 's Spinney , where he have be summon by a anonymous note , couch in blackmail term , and threaten to reveal certain matter to he wife unless he comply with its demand .
the prisoner have , accordingly , go to the appoint spot , and after wait there vainly for half a hour have return home .
unfortunately , he have meet with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of he story , but luckily he have keep the note , and it would be produce as evidence .
as for the statement relate to the destruction of the will , the prisoner have formerly practice at the bar , and be perfectly well aware that the will make in he favour a year before be automatically revoke by he stepmother 's remarriage .
he would call evidence to show who do destroy the will , and it be possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case .
finally , he would point out to the jury that there be evidence against other people besides John Cavendish .
he would direct they attention to the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish be quite as strong , if not stronger than that against he brother .
he would now call the prisoner .
John acquit himself well in the witness-box .
under Sir Ernest 's skilful handling , he tell he tale credibly and well .
the anonymous note receive by he be produce , and hand to the jury to examine .
the readiness with which he admit he financial difficulty , and the disagreement with he stepmother , lend value to he denial .
at the close of he examination , he pause , and say : I should like to make one thing clear .
I utterly reject and disapprove of Sir Ernest Heavywether 's insinuation against my brother .
my brother , I be convinced , have no more to do with the crime than I have .
Sir Ernest merely smile , and note with a sharp eye that John 's protest have produce a very favourable impression on the jury .
then the cross-examination begin .
I understand you to say that it never enter you head that the witness at the inquest could possibly have mistake you voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp .
be not that very surprising ?
no , I do not think so .
I be tell there have be a quarrel between my mother and Mr. Inglethorp , and it never occur to I that such be not really the case .
not when the servant Dorcas repeat certain fragment of the conversation.fragments conversation.fragments which you must have recognize ?
I do not recognize they .
you memory must be unusually short !
no , but we be both angry , and , I think , say more than we mean .
I pay very little attention to my mother 's actual word .
Mr. Philips ' incredulous sniff be a triumph of forensic skill .
he pass on to the subject of the note . you .
have produce this note very opportunely .
tell I , be there nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it ?
not that I know of .
do you not think that it bear a marked resemblance to you own hand-writing . carelessly hand-writing . carelessly disguise ?
no , I do not think so .
I put it to you that it be you own hand-writing !
no .
I put it to you that , anxious to prove a alibi , you conceive the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment , and write this note yourself in order to bear out you statement !
no .
be it not a fact that , at the time you claim to have be wait about at a solitary and unfrequented spot , you be really in the chemist 's shop in Styles St.
Mary , where you purchase strychnine in the name of Alfred Inglethorp ?
no , that be a lie .
I put it to you that , wear a suit of Mr. Inglethorp 's clothes , with a black beard trim to resemble he , you be there.and sign the register in he name !
that be absolutely untrue .
then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between the note , the register , and you own , to the consideration of the jury , say Mr. Philips , and sit down with the air of a man who have do he duty , but who be nevertheless horrify by such deliberate perjury .
after this , as it be grow late , the case be adjourn till Monday .
Poirot , I notice , be look profoundly discourage .
he have that little frown between the eye that I know so well .
what be it , Poirot ?
I inquire .
ah , mon ami , thing be go badly , badly .
in spite of myself , my heart give a leap of relief .
evidently there be a likelihood of John Cavendish be acquit .
when we reach the house , my little friend wave aside Mary 's offer of tea .
no , I thank you , madame .
I will mount to my room .
I follow he .
still frown , he go across to the desk and take out a small pack of patience card .
then he draw up a chair to the table , and , to my utter amazement , begin solemnly to build card house !
my jaw drop involuntarily , and he say at once : no , mon ami , I be not in my second childhood !
I steady my nerve , that be all .
this employment require precision of the finger .
with precision of the finger go precision of the brain .
and never have I need that more than now !
what be the trouble ? I ask .
with a great thump on the table , poirot demolish he carefully build up edifice .
it be this , mon ami !
that I can build card house seven story high , but I can not ôçô thump ôçô find ôçô thump - that last link of which I speak to you .
I could not quite tell what to say , so I hold my peace , and he begin slowly build up the card again , speak in jerk as he do so .
it be done.so !
by placing.one card.on another.with mathematical.precision !
I watch the card house rise under he hand , story by story .
he never hesitate or falter .
it be really almost like a conjure trick .
what a steady hand you have get , I remark .
I believe I have only see you hand shake once .
on a occasion when I be enraged , without doubt , observe Poirot , with great placidity .
yes indeed !
you be in a towering rage .
do you remember ?
it be when you discover that the lock of the despatch-case in mr.s . Inglethorp 's bedroom have be force .
you stand by the mantel-piece , twiddle the thing on it in you usual fashion , and you hand shake like a leaf !
I must say . . but I stop suddenly .
for Poirot , utter a hoarse and inarticulate cry , again annihilate he masterpiece of card , and put he hand over he eye sway backwards and forwards , apparently suffer the keenest agony .
good heaven , Poirot ! I cry .
what be the matter ?
be you take ill ?
no , no , he gasp .
it is.it is.that I have a idea !
oh !
I exclaim , much relieved .
one of you ` little idea ' ?
ah , ma foi , no !
Replied Poirot frankly .
this time it be a idea gigantic !
stupendous !
and you.you , my friend , have give it to I !
suddenly clasp I in he arm , he kiss I warmly on both cheek , and before I have recover from my surprise run headlong from the room .
Mary Cavendish enter at that moment .
what be the matter with Monsieur Poirot ?
he rush past I cry out : ` a garage !
for the love of Heaven , direct I to a garage , madame ! ' .
and , before I could answer , he have dash out into the street . I .
hurry to the window .
true enough , there he be , tear down the street , hatless , and gesticulate as he go .
I turn to Mary with a gesture of despair .
he will be stop by a policeman in another minute .
there he go , round the corner !
we eye meet , and we stare helplessly at one another .
what can be the matter ?
I shake my head .
I do not know .
he be build card house , when suddenly he say he have a idea , and rush off as you see .
well , say Mary , I expect he will be back before dinner .
but night fall , and Poirot have not return .
Poirot 's abrupt departure have intrigue we all greatly .
Sunday morning wear away , and still he do not reappear .
but about three o'clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drive we to the window , to see Poirot alight from a car , accompany by Japp and Summerhaye .
the little man be transform .
he radiate a absurd complacency .
he bow with exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish .
Madame , I have you permission to hold a little reunion in the salon ?
it be necessary for every one to attend .
Mary smile sadly .
you know , Monsieur Poirot , that you have carte blanche in every way .
you be too amiable , madame .
still beam , Poirot marshal we all into the drawing-room , bring forward chair as he do so .
Miss Howard.here .
Howard.here .
Mademoiselle Cynthia .
Monsieur Lawrence .
the good Dorcas .
and Annie .
Bien !
we must delay we proceedings a few minute until Mr. Inglethorp arrive .
I have send he a note .
Miss Howard rise immediately from she seat .
if that man come into the house , I leave it !
no , no !
Poirot go up to she and plead in a low voice .
finally Miss Howard consent to return to she chair .
a few minute later Alfred Inglethorp enter the room .
the company once assemble , Poirot rise from he seat with the air of a popular lecturer , and bow politely to he audience .
Messieurs , mesdame , as you all know , I be call in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case .
I at once examine the bedroom of the deceased which , by the advice of the doctor , have be keep lock , and be consequently exactly as it have be when the tragedy occur .
I find : first , a fragment of green material ; second , a stain on the carpet near the window , still damp ; thirdly , a empty box of bromide powder .
to take the fragment of green material first , I find it catch in the bolt of the communicate door between that room and the adjoining one occupy by Mademoiselle Cynthia .
I hand the fragment over to the police who do not consider it of much importance .
nor do they recognize it for what it was.a piece tear from a green land armlet .
there be a little stir of excitement .
now there be only one person at style who work on the land.mr.s . Cavendish .
therefore it must have be mr.s . Cavendish who enter the decease 's room through the door communicate with Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room .
but that door be bolt on the inside ! I cry .
when I examine the room , yes .
but in the first place we have only she word for it , since it be she who try that particular door and report it fasten .
in the ensue confusion she would have have ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across .
I take a early opportunity of verify my conjecture .
to begin with , the fragment correspond exactly with a tear in mr.s . Cavendish 's armlet .
also , at the inquest , mr.s . Cavendish declare that she have hear , from she own room , the fall of the table by the bed .
I take a early opportunity of testing that statement by station my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building , just outside mr.s . Cavendish 's door .
I myself , in company with the police , go to the decease 's room , and whilst there I , apparently accidentally , knock over the table in question , but find that , as I have expect , Monsieur Hastings have hear no sound at all .
this confirm my belief that mr.s . Cavendish be not speak the truth when she declare that she have be dress in she room at the time of the tragedy .
in fact , I be convince that , far from have be in she own room , mr.s . Cavendish be actually in the decease 's room when the alarm be give .
I shoot a quick glance at Mary .
she be very pale , but smile .
I proceed to reason on that assumption .
mr.s . Cavendish be in she mother-in-law 's mother-in-law 's room .
we will say that she be seek for something and have not yet find it .
suddenly mr.s . inglethorp awaken and be seize with a alarming paroxysm .
she fling out she arm , overturn the bed table , and then pull desperately at the bell .
mr.s . Cavendish , startle , drop she candle , scatter the grease on the carpet .
she pick it up , and retreat quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room , close the door behind she .
she hurry out into the passage , for the servant must not find she where she be .
but it be too late !
already footstep be echo along the gallery which connect the two wing .
what can she do ?
quick as thought , she hurry back to the young girl 's room , and start shake she awake .
the hastily arouse household come troop down the passage .
they be all busily batter at Mr.s . Inglethorp 's door .
it occur to nobody that mr.s . Cavendish have not arrive with the rest , but.and this be significant.i can find no one who see she come from the other wing .
he look at Mary Cavendish .
be I right , madame ?
she bow she head .
quite right , monsieur .
you understand that , if I have think I would do my husband any good by reveal these fact , I would have do so .
but it do not seem to I to bear upon the question of he guilt or innocence .
in a sense , that be correct , madame .
but it clear my mind of many misconception , and leave I free to see other fact in they true significance .
the will ! cry Lawrence .
then it be you , Mary , who destroy the will ?
she shake she head , and Poirot shake he also .
no , he say quietly .
there be only one person who could possibly have destroy that will.mr.s . Inglethorp herself !
impossible !
I exclaim .
she have only make it out that very afternoon !
nevertheless , mon ami , it be Mr.s . Inglethorp .
because , in no other way can you account for the fact that , on one of the hottest day of the year , mr.s . inglethorp order a fire to be light in she room .
I give a gasp .
what idiot we have be never to think of that fire as be incongruous !
Poirot be continue : the temperature on that day , monsieur , be 80 degree in the shade .
yet mr.s . inglethorp order a fire !
why ?
because she wish to destroy something , and could think of no other way .
you will remember that , in consequence of the War economics practice at style , no waste paper be throw away .
there be therefore no means of destroy a thick document such as a will .
the moment I hear of a fire be light in mr.s . Inglethorp 's room , I leap to the conclusion that it be to destroy some important document.possibly a will .
so the discovery of the char fragment in the grate be no surprise to I .
I do not , of course , know at the time that the will in question have only be make this afternoon , and I will admit that , when I learn that fact , I fall into a grievous error .
I come to the conclusion that mr.s . Inglethorp 's determination to destroy she will arise as a direct consequence of the quarrel she have that afternoon , and that therefore the quarrel take place after , and not before the making of the will .
here , as we know , I be wrong , and I be force to abandon that idea .
I face the problem from a new standpoint .
now , at 4 o'clock , Dorcas overhear she mistress say angrily : ` you need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter I . ' .
I conjecture , and conjecture rightly , that these word be address , not to she husband , but to Mr. John Cavendish .
at 5 o'clock , a hour later , she use almost the same word , but the standpoint be different .
she admit to Dorcas , ` I do not know what to do ; scandal between husband and wife be a dreadful thing . ' .
at 4 o'clock she have be angry , but completely mistress of herself .
at 5 o'clock she be in violent distress , and speak of have have a great shock .
look at the matter psychologically , I draw one deduction which I be convince be correct .
the second ` scandal ' she speak of be not the same as the first.and it concerned herself !
let we reconstruct .
at 4 o'clock , mr.s . inglethorp quarrel with she son , and threaten to denounce he to he wife.who , wife.who , by the way , overhear the greater part of the conversation .
at 4.30 , .
mr.s . Inglethorp , in consequence of a conversation on the validity of will , make a will in favour of she husband , which the two gardener witness .
at 5 o'clock , Dorcas find she mistress in a state of considerable agitation , with a slip of paper . ` a letter , ' Dorcas thinks.in she hand , and it be then that she order the fire in she room to be light .
presumably , then , between 4.30 .
and 5 o'clock , something have occur to occasion a complete revolution of feeling , since she be now as anxious to destroy the will , as she be before to make it .
what be that something ?
as far as we know , she be quite alone during that half-hour .
half-hour .
nobody enter or leave that boudoir .
what then occasion this sudden change of sentiment ?
one can only guess , but I believe my guess to be correct .
mr.s . inglethorp have no stamp in she desk .
we know this , because later she ask Dorcas to bring she some .
now in the opposite corner of the room stand she husband 's desk.locked .
she be anxious to find some stamp , and , accord to my theory , she try she own key in the desk .
that one of they fit I know .
she therefore open the desk , and in search for the stamp she come across something else.that slip of paper which Dorcas see in she hand , and which assuredly be never mean for mr.s . Inglethorp 's eye .
on the other hand , mr.s . Cavendish believe that the slip of paper to which she mother-in-law cling so tenaciously be a write proof of she own husband 's infidelity .
she demand it from mr.s . inglethorp who assure she , quite truly , that it have nothing to do with that matter .
mr.s . Cavendish do not believe she .
she think that mr.s . inglethorp be shield she stepson .
now mr.s . Cavendish be a very resolute woman , and , behind she mask of reserve , she be madly jealous of she husband .
she determine to get hold of that paper at all cost , and in this resolution chance come to she aid .
she happen to pick up the key of mr.s . Inglethorp 's despatch-case , which have be lose that morning .
she know that she mother-in-law invariably keep all important papers in this particular case .
mr.s . Cavendish , therefore , make she plan as only a woman drive desperate through jealousy could have do .
some time in the evening she unbolt the door lead into Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room .
possibly she apply oil to the hinge , for I find that it open quite noiselessly when I try it .
she put off she project until the early hour of the morning as be safer , since the servant be accustom to hear she move about she room at that time .
she dress completely in she land kit , and make she way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room into that of mr.s . inglethorp .
he pause a moment , and Cynthia interrupt : but I should have wake up if anyone have come through my room ?
not if you be drug , mademoiselle .
drug ?
Mais , oui !
you remember . he address we collectively again . that again . that through all the tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia sleep .
that admit of two possibility .
either she sleep be feigned.which I do not believe.or she unconsciousness be indeed by artificial means .
with this latter idea in my mind , I examine all the coffee-cup most carefully , remember that it be Mr.s . Cavendish who have bring Mademoiselle Cynthia she coffee the night before .
I take a sample from each cup , and have they analysed.with no result .
I have count the cup carefully , in the event of one have be remove .
six person have take coffee , and six cup be duly find .
I have to confess myself mistaken .
then I discover that I have be guilty of a very grave oversight .
Coffee have be bring in for seven person , not six , for DrBauerstein have be there that evening .
this change the face of the whole affair , for there be now one cup miss .
the servant notice nothing , since Annie , the housemaid , who take in the coffee , bring in seven cup , not know that Mr. Inglethorp never drink it , whereas Dorcas , who clear they away the follow morning , find six as usual.or strictly speak she find five , the sixth be the one find break in mr.s . Inglethorp 's room .
I be confident that the miss cup be that of Mademoiselle Cynthia .
I have a additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cup find contain sugar , which Mademoiselle Cynthia never take in she coffee .
my attention be attract by the story of Annie about some ` salt ' on the tray of cocoa which she take every night to mr.s . Inglethorp 's room .
I accordingly secure a sample of that cocoa , and send it to be analyse .
but that have already be do by dr bauerstein , say Lawrence quickly .
not exactly .
the analyst be ask by he to report whether strychnine be , or be not , present .
he do not have it test , as I do , for a narcotic .
for a narcotic ?
yes .
here be the analyst 's report .
mr.s . Cavendish administer a safe , but effectual , narcotic to both mr.s . inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia .
and it be possible that she have a mauvais quart d'heure in consequence !
imagine she feeling when she mother-in-law be suddenly take ill and die , and immediately after she hear the word ` poison ' !
she have believe that the sleep draught she administer be perfectly harmless , but there be no doubt that for one terrible moment she must have fear that mr.s . Inglethorp 's death lay at she door .
she be seize with panic , and under its influence she hurry downstairs , and quickly drop the coffee-cup and saucer use by Mademoiselle Cynthia into a large brass vase , where it be discover later by Monsieur Lawrence .
the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch .
too many eye be upon she .
guess at she relief when strychnine be mention , and she discover that after all the tragedy be not she do .
we be now able to account for the symptom of strychnine poisoning be so long in make they appearance .
a narcotic take with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hour .
Poirot pause .
Mary look up at he , the colour slowly rise in she face .
all you have say be quite true , Monsieur Poirot .
it be the most awful hour of my life .
I shall never forget it .
but you be wonderful .
I understand now . .
what I mean when I tell you that you could safely confess to papa poirot , eh ?
but you would not trust I .
I see everything now , say Lawrence .
the drug cocoa , take on top of the poison coffee , amply account for the delay .
exactly .
but be the coffee poison , or be it not ?
we come to a little difficulty here , since mr.s . inglethorp never drink it .
what ?
the cry of surprise be universal .
no .
you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mr.s . Inglethorp 's room ?
there be some peculiar point about that stain .
it be still damp , it exhale a strong odour of coffee , and imbed in the nap of the carpet I find some little splinter of china .
what have happen be plain to I , for not two minute before I have place my little case on the table near the window , and the table , tilt up , have deposit it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot .
in exactly the same way , mr.s . inglethorp have lay down she cup of coffee on reach she room the night before , and the treacherous table have play she the same trick .
what happen next be mere guess work on my part , but I should say that mr.s . inglethorp pick up the broken cup and place it on the table by the bed .
feel in need of a stimulant of some kind , she heat up she cocoa , and drink it off then and there .
now we be face with a new problem .
we know the cocoa contain no strychnine .
the coffee be never drunk .
yet the strychnine must have be administer between seven and nine o'clock that evening .
what third medium be there.a medium so suitable for disguise the taste of strychnine that it be extraordinary no one have think of it ?
Poirot look round the room , and then answer himself impressively .
she medicine !
do you mean that the murderer introduce the strychnine into she tonic ? I cry .
there be no need to introduce it .
it be already there.in the mixture .
the strychnine that kill mr.s . inglethorp be the identical strychnine prescribe by Dr Wilkins .
to make that clear to you , I will read you a extract from a book on dispense which I find in the Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster : ` the follow prescription have become famous in text book : strychninae mix with bromide .
this solution deposit in a few hour the greater part of the strychnine salt as a insoluble bromide in transparent crystal .
a lady in England lose she life by take a similar mixture : the precipitated strychnine collect at the bottom , and in take the last dose she swallow nearly all of it ! ' .
now there be , of course , no bromide in Dr Wilkins ' prescription , but you will remember that I mention a empty box of bromide powder .
one or two of those powder introduce into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine , as the book describe , and cause it to be take in the last dose .
you will learn later that the person who usually pour out mr.s . Inglethorp 's medicine be always extremely careful not to shake the bottle , but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed .
throughout the case , there have be evidence that the tragedy be intend to take place on Monday evening .
on that day , mr.s . Inglethorp 's bell wire be neatly cut , and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia be spend the night with friend , so that mr.s . inglethorp would have be quite alone in the right wing , completely shut off from help of any kind , and would have die , in all probability , before medical aid could have be summon .
but in she hurry to be in time for the village entertainment mr.s . inglethorp forget to take she medicine , and the next day she lunch away from home , so that the last.and fatal.dose be actually take twenty-four hour later than have be anticipate by the murderer ; and it be owe to that delay that the final proof.the last link of the chain.is now in my hand .
amid breathless excitement , he hold out three thin strip of paper .
a letter in the murderer 's own hand-writing , mes amis !
have it be a little clearer in its term , it be possible that mr.s . Inglethorp , warn in time , would have escape . .
as it be , she realize she danger , but not the manner of it .
in the deathly silence , Poirot piece together the slip of paper and , clear he throat , read : ` Dearest Evelyn : ` you will be anxious at hear nothing .
it be all right.only it will be tonight instead of last night .
you understand .
there be a good time come once the old woman be dead and out of the way .
no one can possibly bring home the crime to I .
that idea of yours about the bromide be a stroke of genius !
but we must be very circumspect .
a false step . . ' here , my friend , the letter break off .
Doubtless the writer be interrupt ; but there can be no question as to he identity .
we all know this hand-writing and . .
a howl that be almost a scream break the silence .
you devil !
how do you get it ?
a chair be overturn .
Poirot skip nimbly aside .
a quick movement on he part , and he assailant fall with a crash .
Messieurs , mesdame , say Poirot , with a flourish , let I introduce you to the murderer , Mr. Alfred Inglethorp !
Poirot , you old villain , I say , I have half a mind to strangle you !
what do you mean by deceive I as you have do ?
we be sit in the library .
several hectic day lay behind we .
in the room below , John and Mary be together once more , while Alfred Inglethorp and Miss Howard be in custody .
now at last , I have Poirot to myself , and could relieve my still burn curiosity .
Poirot do not answer I for a moment , but at last he say : I do not deceive you , mon ami .
at most , I permit you to deceive yourself .
yes , but why ?
well , it be difficult to explain .
you see , my friend , you have a nature so honest , and a countenance so transparent , that.enfin , to conceal you feeling be impossible !
if I have tell you my idea , the very first time you see Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman would have.in you so expressive idiom . ` smell a rat ' !
and then , bon jour to we chance of catch he !
I think that I have more diplomacy than you give I credit for .
my friend , besought Poirot , I implore you , do not enrage yourself !
you help have be of the most invaluable .
it be but the extremely beautiful nature that you have , which make I pause .
well , I grumble , a little mollify .
I still think you might have give I a hint .
but I do , my friend .
several hint .
you would not take they .
think now , do I ever say to you that I believe John Cavendish guilty ?
do I not , on the contrary , tell you that he would almost certainly be acquit ?
yes , but . .
and do I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bring the murderer to justice ?
be it not plain to you that I be speak of two entirely different person ?
no , I say , it be not plain to I !
then again , continue Poirot , at the beginning , do I not repeat to you several time that I do not want Mr. Inglethorp arrest now ?
that should have convey something to you .
do you mean to say you suspect he as long ago as that ?
yes .
to begin with , whoever else might benefit by mr.s . Inglethorp 's death , she husband would benefit the most .
there be no get away from that .
when I go up to style with you that first day , I have no idea as to how the crime have be commit , but from what I know of Mr. Inglethorp I fancy that it would be very hard to find anything to connect he with it .
when I arrive at the chateau , I realize at once that it be Mr.s . Inglethorp who have burn the will ; and there , by the way , you can not complain , my friend , for I try my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer .
yes , yes , I say impatiently .
go on .
well , my friend , as I say , my view as to Mr. Inglethorp 's guilt be very much shake .
there be , in fact , so much evidence against he that I be incline to believe that he have not do it .
when do you change you mind ?
when I find that the more effort I make to clear he , the more effort he make to get himself arrest .
then , when I discover that Inglethorp have nothing to do with mr.s . Raikes and that in fact it be John Cavendish who be interested in that quarter , I be quite sure .
but why ?
simply this .
if it have be Inglethorp who be carry on a intrigue with mr.s . Raikes , he silence be perfectly comprehensible .
but , when I discover that it be know all over the village that it be John who be attract by the farmer 's pretty wife , he silence bear quite a different interpretation .
it be nonsense to pretend that he be afraid of the scandal , as no possible scandal could attach to he .
this attitude of he give I furiously to think , and I be slowly force to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp want to be arrest .
eh bien !
from that moment , I be equally determine that he should not be arrest .
wait a minute .
I do not see why he wish to be arrest ?
because , mon ami , it be the law of you country that a man once acquit can never be try again for the same offence .
aha !
but it be clever.his idea !
assuredly , he be a man of method .
see here , he know that in he position he be bind to be suspect , so he conceive the exceedingly clever idea of prepare a lot of manufactured evidence against himself .
he wish to be arrest .
he would then produce he irreproachable alibi.and , hey presto , he be safe for life !
but I still do not see how he manage to prove he alibi , and yet go to the chemist 's shop ?
Poirot stare at I in surprise .
be it possible ?
my poor friend !
you have not yet realize that it be Miss Howard who go to the chemist 's shop ?
Miss Howard ?
but , certainly .
who else ?
it be most easy for she .
she be of a good height , she voice be deep and manly ; moreover , remember , she and Inglethorp be cousin , and there be a distinct resemblance between they , especially in they gait and bearing .
it be simplicity itself .
they be a clever pair !
I be still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business be do , I remark .
Bon !
I will reconstruct for you as far as possible .
I be incline to think that Miss Howard be the master mind in that affair .
you remember she once mention that she father be a doctor ?
possibly she dispense he medicine for he , or she may have take the idea from one of the many book lie about when Mademoiselle Cynthia be study for she exam .
anyway , she be familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture contain strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter .
probably the idea come to she quite suddenly .
mr.s . inglethorp have a box of bromide powder , which she occasionally take at night .
what could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powder in mr.s . Inglethorp 's large size bottle of medicine when it come from Coot 's ?
the risk be practically nil .
the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later .
if anyone have see either of they touch the medicine , they will have forget it by that time .
Miss Howard will have engineer she quarrel , and depart from the house .
the lapse of time , and she absence , will defeat all suspicion .
yes , it be a clever idea !
if they have leave it alone , it be possible the crime might never have be bring home to they .
but they be not satisfy .
they try to be too clever.and that be they undoing .
Poirot puff at he tiny cigarette , he eye fix on the ceiling .
they arrange a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish , by buy strychnine at the village chemist 's , and sign the register in he hand-writing .
on Monday Mr.s . Inglethorp will take the last dose of she medicine .
on Monday , therefore , at six o'clock , Alfred Inglethorp arrange to be see by a number of people at a spot far remove from the village .
Miss Howard have previously make up a cock and bull story about he and mr.s . Raikes to account for he hold he tongue afterwards .
at six o'clock , Miss Howard , disguise as Alfred Inglethorp , enter the chemist 's shop , with she story about a dog , obtain the strychnine , and write the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John 's handwriting , which she have previously study carefully .
but , as it will never do if John , too , can prove a alibi , she write he a anonymous note.still copying he hand-writing . which take he to a remote spot where it be exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see he .
so far , all go well .
Miss Howard go back to Middlingham .
Alfred Inglethorp return to style .
there be nothing that can compromise he in any way , since it be Miss Howard who have the strychnine , which , after all , be only want as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish.But .
now a hitch occur .
mr.s . inglethorp do not take she medicine that night .
the broken bell , Cynthia 's absence.arranged by inglethorp through he wife.all these be waste .
and then.he make he slip .
mr.s . inglethorp be out , and he sit down to write to he accomplice , who , he fear , may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of they plan .
it be probable that mr.s . inglethorp return earlier than he expect .
Caught in the act , and somewhat flurry he hastily shut and lock he desk .
he fear that if he remain in the room he may have to open it again , and that mr.s . inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up .
so he go out and walk in the wood , little dream that mr.s . Inglethorp will open he desk , and discover the incriminate document .
but this , as we know , be what happen .
mr.s . inglethorp read it , and become aware of the perfidy of she husband and Evelyn Howard , though , unfortunately , the sentence about the bromide convey no warn to she mind .
she know that she be in danger.but be ignorant of where the danger lie .
she decide to say nothing to she husband , but sit down and write to she solicitor , ask he to come on the morrow , and she also determine to destroy immediately the will which she have just make .
she keep the fatal letter .
it be to discover that letter , then , that she husband force the lock of the despatch-case ?
yes , and from the enormous risk he run we can see how fully he realize its importance .
that letter except , there be absolutely nothing to connect he with the crime .
there be only one thing I can not make out , why do not he destroy it at once when he get hold of it ?
because he do not dare take the biggest risk of all.that of keep it on he own person .
I do not understand .
look at it from he point of view .
I have discover that there be only five short minute in which he could have take it.the five minute immediately before we own arrival on the scene , for before that time Annie be brushing the stair , and would have see anyone who pass go to the right wing .
figure to yourself the scene !
he enter the room , unlock the door by means of one of the other doorkeys.they be all much alike .
he hurry to the despatch-case . it be lock , and the key be nowhere to be see .
that be a terrible blow to he , for it mean that he presence in the room can not be conceal as he have hope .
but he see clearly that everything must be risk for the sake of that damn piece of evidence .
quickly , he force the lock with a penknife , and turn over the papers until he find what he be look for .
but now a fresh dilemma arise : he dare not keep that piece of paper on he .
he may be see leave the room.he may be search .
if the paper be find on he , it be certain doom .
probably , at this minute , too , he hear the sound below of Mr. Wells and John leave the boudoir .
he must act quickly .
where can he hide this terrible slip of paper ?
the contents of the waste-paper-basket waste-paper-basket be keep and in any case , be sure to be examine .
there be no means of destroy it ; and he dare not keep it .
he look round , and he sees.what do you think , mon amus ?
I shake my head .
in a moment , he have tear the letter into long thin strip , and roll they up into spill he thrust they hurriedly in amongst the other spill in the vase on the mantle-piece .
I utter a exclamation .
no one would think of look there , Poirot continue .
and he will be able , at he leisure , to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against he .
then , all the time , it be in the spill vase in mr.s . Inglethorp 's bedroom , under we very nose ? I cry .
Poirot nod .
yes , my friend .
that be where I discover my ` last link , ' and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you .
to I ?
yes .
do you remember tell I that my hand shake as I be straighten the ornament on the mantel-piece ?
yes , but I do not see . .
no but I see .
do you know , my friend , I remember that earlier in the morning , when we have be there together , I have straighten all the object on the mantel-piece .
mantel-piece .
and , if they be already straighten , there would be no need to straighten they again , unless , in the meantime , some one else have touch they .
Dear I , I murmur , so that be the explanation of you extraordinary behaviour .
you rush down to style , and find it still there ?
yes , and it be a race for time .
but I still can not understand why Inglethorp be such a fool as to leave it there when he have plenty of opportunity to destroy it .
ah , but he have no opportunity .
I see to that .
you ?
yes .
do you remember reprove I for take the household into my confidence on the subject ?
yes .
well , my friend , I see there be just one chance .
I be not sure then if Inglethorp be the criminal or not , but if he be I reason that he would not have the paper on he , but would have hide it somewhere , and by enlist the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent he destroy it .
he be already under suspicion , and by make the matter public I secure the service of about ten amateur detective , who would be watch he unceasingly , and be himself aware of they watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document .
he be therefore force to depart from the house , leave it in the spill vase .
but surely Miss Howard have ample opportunity of aid he .
yes , but Miss Howard do not know of the paper 's existence .
in accordance with they prearranged plan , she never speak to Alfred Inglethorp .
they be suppose to be deadly enemy , and until John Cavendish be safely convict they neither of they dare risk a meeting .
of course I have a watch keep on Mr. Inglethorp , hope that sooner or later he would lead I to the hiding-place .
but he be too clever to take any chance .
the paper be safe where it be ; since no one have think of look there in the first week , it be not likely they would do so afterwards .
but for you lucky remark , we might never have be able to bring he to justice .
I understand that now ; but when do you first begin to suspect Miss Howard ?
when I discover that she have tell a lie at the inquest about the letter she have receive from mr.s . inglethorp .
why , what be there to lie about ?
you see that letter ?
do you recall its general appearance ?
yes.more or less .
you will recollect , then , that mr.s . inglethorp write a very distinctive hand , and leave large clear space between she word .
but if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that ` July 17th ' be quite different in this respect .
do you see what I mean ?
no , I confess , I do not .
you do not see that that letter be not write on the 17th , but on the 7th . the 7th . the day after Miss Howard 's departure ?
the ' 1 ' be write in before the ' 7 ' to turn it into the ' 17th ' .
but why ?
that be exactly what I ask myself .
why do Miss Howard suppress the letter write on the 17th , and produce this fake one instead ?
because she do not wish to show the letter of the 17th .
why , again ?
and at once a suspicion dawn in my mind .
you will remember my say that it be wise to beware of people who be not tell you the truth .
and yet , I cry indignantly , after that , you give I two reason why Miss Howard could not have commit the crime !
and very good reason too , reply Poirot .
for a long time they be a stumbling-block to I until I remember a very significant fact : that she and Alfred Inglethorp be cousin .
she could not have commit the crime single-handed , but the reason against that do not debar she from be a accomplice .
and , then , there be that rather over-vehement over-vehement hatred of hers !
it conceal a very opposite emotion .
there be , undoubtedly , a tie of passion between they long before he come to style .
they have already arrange they infamous plot.that he should marry this rich , but rather foolish old lady , induce she to make a will leave she money to he , and then gain they end by a very cleverly conceive crime .
if all have go as they plan , they would probably have leave England , and live together on they poor victim 's money .
they be a very astute and unscrupulous pair .
while suspicion be to be direct against he , she would be make quiet preparation for a very different denouement .
she arrive from middlingham with all the compromise item in she possession .
no suspicion attach to she .
no notice be pay to she coming and go in the house .
she hide the strychnine and glass in John 's room .
she put the beard in the attic .
she will see to it that sooner or later they be duly discover .
I do not quite see why they try to fix the blame on John , I remark .
it would have be much easier for they to bring the crime home to Lawrence .
yes , but that be mere chance .
all the evidence against he arise out of pure accident .
it must , in fact , have be distinctly annoying to the pair of schemer .
he manner be unfortunate , I observe thoughtfully .
yes .
you realize , of course , what be at the back of that ?
no .
you do not understand that he believe Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of the crime ?
no , I exclaim , astonish .
impossible !
not at all .
I myself nearly have the same idea .
it be in my mind when I ask Mr. Wells that first question about the will .
then there be the bromide powder which she have make up , and she clever male impersonation , as Dorcas recount they to we .
there be really more evidence against she than anyone else .
you be joke , Poirot !
no .
shall I tell you what make Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he first enter he mother 's room on the fatal night ?
it be because , whilst he mother lay there , obviously poison , he see , over you shoulder , that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room be unbolted .
but he declare that he see it bolt ! I cry .
exactly , say Poirot dryly .
and that be just what confirm my suspicion that it be not .
he be shield Mademoiselle Cynthia .
but why should he shield she ?
because he be in love with she .
I laugh .
there , Poirot , you be quite wrong !
I happen to know for a fact that , far from be in love with she , he positively dislikes she .
who tell you that , mon amus ?
Cynthia herself .
La pauvre petite !
and she be concern ?
she say that she do not mind at all .
then she certainly do mind very much , remark Poirot .
they be like that.les femme !
what you say about Lawrence be a great surprise to I , I say .
but why?ÔÇ ?
ôç £ it be most obvious .
do not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia speak and laugh with he brother ?
he have take it into he long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia be in love with Monsieur John .
when he enter he mother 's room , and see she obviously poison , he jump to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia know something about the matter .
he be nearly drive desperate .
first he crush the coffee-cup to powder under he foot , remember that she have go up with he mother the night before , and he determine that there should be no chance of test its contents .
Thenceforward , he strenuously , and quite uselessly , uphold the theory of ` death from natural cause ' . and .
what about the ` extra coffee-cup ' ?
I be fairly certain that it be Mr.s . Cavendish who have hide it , but I have to make sure .
Monsieur Lawrence do not know at all what I mean ; but , on reflection , he come to the conclusion that if he could find a extra coffee-cup anywhere he lady love would be clear of suspicion .
and he be perfectly right .
one thing more .
what do Mr.s . Inglethorp mean by she die word ?
they be , of course , a accusation against she husband .
Dear I , Poirot , I say with a sigh , I think you have explain everything .
I be glad it have all end so happily .
even John and he wife be reconcile .
thanks to I .
how do you mean.thanks to you ?
my dear friend , do you not realize that it be simply and solely the trial which have bring they together again ?
that John Cavendish still love he wife , I be convince .
also , that she be equally in love with he .
but they have drift very far apart .
it all arise from a misunderstanding .
she marry he without love .
he know it .
he be a sensitive man in he way , he would not force himself upon she if she do not want he .
and , as he withdraw , she love awake .
but they be both unusually proud , and they pride hold they inexorably apart .
he drift into a entanglement with mr.s . Raikes , and she deliberately cultivate the friendship of Dr Bauerstein .
do you remember the day of John Cavendish 's arrest , when you find I deliberate over a big decision ?
yes , I quite understand you distress .
pardon I , mon ami , but you do not understand it in the least .
I be try to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once .
I could have clear him.though it might have mean a failure to convict the real criminal .
they be entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment.which moment.which partly account for my success .
do you mean that you could have save John Cavendish from be bring to trial ?
yes , my friend .
but I eventually decide in favour of ` a woman 's happiness ' .
nothing but the great danger through which they have pass could have bring these two proud soul together again .
I look at Poirot in silent amazement .
the colossal cheek of the little man !
who on earth but Poirot would have think of a trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness !
I perceive you thought , mon ami , say Poirot , smile at I .
no one but Hercule Poirot would have attempt such a thing !
and you be wrong in condemn it .
the happiness of one man and one woman be the greatest thing in all the world .
he word take I back to earlier event .
I remember Mary as she lay white and exhaust on the sofa , listen , listen .
there have come the sound of the bell below .
she have start up .
Poirot have open the door , and meet she agonized eye have nod gently .
yes , madame , he say .
I have bring he back to you .
he have stand aside , and as I go out I have see the look in Mary 's eye , as John Cavendish have catch he wife in he arm .
perhaps you be right , Poirot , I say gently .
yes , it be the greatest thing in the world .
suddenly , there be a tap at the door , and Cynthia peep in .
I.I only . .
come in , I say , spring up .
she come in , but do not sit down .
i.only want to tell you something . .
yes ?
Cynthia fidget with a little tassel for some moment , then , suddenly exclaim : you dear !
kiss first I and then Poirot , and rush out of the room again .
what on earth do this mean ? I ask , surprise .
it be very nice to be kiss by Cynthia , but the publicity of the salute rather impair the pleasure .
it mean that she have discover Monsieur Lawrence do not dislike she as much as she think , reply Poirot philosophically .
but . . here he be .
Lawrence at that moment pass the door .
eh !
Monsieur Lawrence , call Poirot .
we must congratulate you , be it not so ?
Lawrence blush , and then smile awkwardly .
a man in love be a sorry spectacle .
now Cynthia have look charming .
I sigh .
what be it , mon amus ?
nothing , I say sadly .
they be two delightful woman !
and neither of they be for you ?
Finished Poirot .
never mind .
Console yourself , my friend .
we may hunt together again , who know ?
